The library <a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react\"><code>gl-react</code></a> wraps WebGL in React paradigm with a focus for developing 2D effects, that we need in my current startup, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProjSeptEng\">Project September</a>, where I have the chance to develop it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"slides\"><a href=\"http://greweb.me/reactmeetup7\">Slides</a></h2>\n<iframe src=\"http://greweb.me/reactmeetup7\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"abstract\">Abstract</h2>\n<p>We can write effects without having to learn the complex and imperative low-level WebGL API but instead composing React components, as simple as functional composition, using VDOM descriptive paradigm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react\">gl-react</a> brings WebGL bindings for react to implement complex effects over content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react-native\">gl-react-native</a> is the React Native implementation,\ntherefore allows universal effects to be written both for web and native.</p>\n<p>These libraries totally hides for you the complexity of using the OpenGL/WebGL API but takes the best part of it: GLSL, which is a &quot;functional rendering&quot; language that runs on GPU.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Introducing gl-react","description":"This presentation is an introduction to WebGL in React and functional programming concept and showcases made with gl-react and gl-react-native","thumbnail":"/images/2015/10/funrendering.png","author":"Gaetan","layout":"post","tags":["gl-react"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
