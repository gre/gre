The yellow is overlapping on top of the red color, I wanted to see if the ink would actually &quot;bleed&quot; and fade from the red to yellow but it didn&#39;t happen, however we have interesting effect at the &quot;end&quot; of the lines (plotting from left to right) because the ink accumulates more on ends. I wanted to see how the medium expresses in a very minimalistic plot. Lines are separed by 0.3 millimeters and the fountain pen stroke width is approximatively of 0.35 millimeters.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/549z.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/images/plots/549z2.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Rougejaune","image":"/images/plots/549.jpg"}},"prev":{"n":"548","key":"./548/README.md","rustFile":"link","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-loop-circleception","content":"<p><strong>This plot is the physical counterpart that was collected via <a href=\"/plots/nft\">/plots/nft</a></strong>.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/548photo.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Wireframe #135","image":"/images/plots/548.gif","video":"/images/plots/548.mp4","sourceFolderURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-loop-circleception","nft":"https://objkt.com/asset/KT1AZYsEjt8HFEXWZUjGVfBxtzKPobNo3x1t/9","tags":["plotloop","circleception"]}},"next":null},"__N_SSG":true}
