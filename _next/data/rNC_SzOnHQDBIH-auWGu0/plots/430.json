The dots are connected with lines that maximize avoiding the circles and &quot;traversing&quot; the polygon rather than connecting lines that would be along an edge. Points are also samples randomly away from the polygon edge in order to avoid too much paper density problem â€“ it creates an interesting border width effect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","data":{"date":"2022-04-09","title":"[NFC] Web","description":"Plotted live during NFC Lisbon conference on 10 cm square watercolor paper with fountain pen.","image":"/images/plots/431.jpg","tags":["nfc","10cm"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
