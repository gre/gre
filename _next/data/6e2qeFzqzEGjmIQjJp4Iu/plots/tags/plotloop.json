Vous savez peut-√™tre que certaines de mes cr√©ations depuis 2021 sont partag√©s sur <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/greweb\">https://twitch.tv/greweb</a>. Le concours √©tait tr√®s int√©ressant pour continuer de d√©mocratiser l&#39;expension de l&#39;art sur Twitch et de cr√©er des liens entre artistes aux styles tr√®s vari√©s.</p>\n<p>J&#39;ai stream√© plusieurs journ√©es sur <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/greweb\">twitch.tv/greweb</a> pour avancer doucement sur plusieurs id√©es en d√©veloppant mon <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art\">g√©n√©rateur d&#39;art g√©n√©ratif</a> tout en l&#39;√©prouvant les traits en utilisant <strong>ma machine de dessin <a href=\"https://www.axidraw.com/\">AxiDraw A3</a> qui est en r√©alit√© un robot sur lequel je met des stylos plumes.</strong> Cette technique appel√© &quot;plotting&quot; est utilis√© par de nombreux artistes, qui partagent quotidiennement leur cr√©ations sur <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23plottertwitter\">#plottertwitter</a>.</p>\n<p><video controls src=\"/images/plots/478-plotlive.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>Le th√®me de cette ann√©e √©tait le <strong>Transhumanisme</strong> ce qui √©pousait particuli√®rement bien le genre de technique que j&#39;utilise ici: le <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding\">code cr√©atif</a> et le <a href=\"/plots\">&quot;plotting&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>J&#39;avais pour but de participer √† la cat√©gorie Digital Art du concours, <strong>l&#39;art g√©n√©ratif √©tant une branche de l&#39;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art\">art digital</a></strong>. C&#39;√©tait clairement un peu audacieux et exp√©rimental du fait de la technique et des outils utilis√©s pour ce concours. Etant le seul √† utiliser ce genre de technique, l&#39;organisation a, au cours du concours, jug√© que je ne rentrais pas dans la cat√©gorie. Le r√®glement a √©t√© pr√©cis√© sur le fait qu&#39;il faut une &quot;base de dessin&quot; dans la cr√©ation afin que le jury puisse juger de r√©sultats &quot;similaires&quot; ce qui est louable.</p>\n<p>Il est difficile de cat√©goriser le monde de l&#39;art. L&#39;art a toujours √©t√© &quot;disruptif&quot; et je l&#39;ai √©t√© cette fois ci. L&#39;art g√©n√©ratif est encore √† ses tout d√©buts comme le montre aussi la surprise de la communaut√©, je remercie tout les viewers qui sont arriv√©s sur mon stream et les nouvelles connaissances que j&#39;ai pu faire. Je remercie √©galement l&#39;organisation qui m&#39;a bien accompagn√©.</p>\n<p>L&#39;art g√©n√©ratif est partout, c&#39;√©tait une opportunit√© de le montrer en √©crivant du code, mais en r√©alit√© nous utilisons tous du g√©n√©ratif sans le savoir. Le logiciel de dessin que vous utilisez (par exemple un pinceau), les textures que vous pouvez trouver sur Blender (notamment la g√©n√©ration de textures proc√©durales),... C&#39;est un outil √† la disposition de l&#39;art num√©rique.</p>\n<p>Les contraintes que je me suis impos√© n&#39;ont pas facilit√© le processus de cr√©ation, et mon oeuvre reste tr√®s modeste (minimaliste et psych√©d√©lique). Cr√©er dans un contexte stressant comme dans une conf√©rence <em>(comme j&#39;ai pu avoir l&#39;opportunit√© de le faire d√©but Avril <a href=\"http://greweb.me/plots/448\">http://greweb.me/plots/448</a>)</em> et ici sur Twitch apporte aussi sa complexit√©. C&#39;√©tait en tout cas un plaisir de passer plus de temps √† expliquer ces m√©thodes que peu de viewers connaissaient.</p>\n<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/478-cameras.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>Il n&#39;ai pas ais√© de maitriser le r√©sultat d&#39;un g√©n√©rateur, on utilise des algorithmes, mais dans le cas du plotting, on doit penser aux contraintes du robot, des encres, du stylo et du papier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"le-processus-de-cr√©ation\">Le processus de cr√©ation</h2>\n<p>J&#39;ai l&#39;habitude de faire des motifs abstraits, des formes un peu fractales, qui tendent de se rapprocher de la nature avec des nuages de bruits, en jouant avec la sym√©trie pour recr√©er al√©atoirement des formes reconnaissables,...</p>\n<p><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/08/artist-1.jpg\" /><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/08/artist-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Le plus gros challenge pour moi dans le contexte de ce concours √©tait d&#39;aller vers un travail de composition avec des formes un peu plus &quot;dessin√©s&quot; et organiques. Il est ais√© d&#39;appliquer un algorithme pour dupliquer plein de fois une primitive, il est moins ais√© d&#39;avoir une composition bien √©quilibr√©e. Le r√©sultat final aurait peut-√™tre m√©rit√© un peu plus de travail √† jouer avec le chaos pour composer la sc√®ne finale.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tout-commence-avec-des-croquis\">Tout commence avec des croquis</h3>\n<p>On a une id√©e, on la couche d√©j√† sur papier. Cela permet d&#39;avoir un but, et on peut commencer √† r√©fl√©chir quelle technique on utilisera pour chaque √©l√©ment de la sc√®ne.</p>\n<p>Ensuite, le gros du travail est it√©ratif et a eu lieu plusieurs jours pour tenter diff√©rentes approches et confronter le but th√©orique √† la r√©alit√© technique.</p>\n<p>Un exemple trivial √©tait de mesurer les proportions de l&#39;Homme de Vitruve et de les implanter dans le code.</p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/478-mesure.jpg\" />\n\n<h3 id=\"lart-g√©n√©ratif-choisir-l√©lu-parmi-des-variantes-al√©atoires\">L&#39;art g√©n√©ratif, choisir l&#39;√©lu parmi des variantes al√©atoires</h3>\n<p>L&#39;art g√©n√©ratif permet, avec un m√™me g√©n√©rateur, de g√©n√©rer une infinit√© de variantes en changeant la &quot;seed&quot; en entr√©e de l&#39;algorithme utilis√©.</p>\n<p>J&#39;ai par exemple, pass√© du temps pour manuellement s√©lectionner la t√™te principale que je voulais parmis une centaines de variantes al√©atoires.</p>\n<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/478-generations.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>Il est int√©ressant de voir que des variations de la t√™te principale vont se retrouver dans le fond de la pi√®ce compl√®te.</p>\n<p>L&#39;art g√©n√©ratif ne consiste pas √† juste √©crire des algorithmes. Il y a en r√©alit√© beaucoup de tests √† faire et il faut ajuster beaucoup de param√®tres pour choisir la zone de variations qui nous int√©resse d&#39;explorer. On it√®re beaucoup de fois jusqu&#39;√† en √™tre satisfait.</p>\n<p>La totalit√© du code que j&#39;ai cr√©√© est originale, certaines techniques comme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem\">TSP</a> utilisent des biblioth√®ques Rust, language de programmation utilis√©.</p>\n<h3 id=\"le-code-est-ma-plume\">Le code est ma plume</h3>\n<p>Ce code cr√©atif a consist√© √† d√©velopper un ensemble de primitives, √©l√©ment &quot;atomique&quot; de la cr√©ation, pour ensuite les utiliser tous ensemble pour former l&#39;oeuvre compl√®te.</p>\n<p>Une primitive peut √™tre par exemple une texture de &quot;brush&quot; qu&#39;un logiciel de dessin va proposer pour dessiner. Elle peut aussi consister √† offrir une technique de &quot;placement&quot; que l&#39;on peut composer avec d&#39;autres primitives, r√©cursivement.</p>\n<p>Pour r√©aliser ma cr√©ation, mon parti pris est de ne jamais dessiner &quot;moi-m√™me&quot; mais d&#39;utiliser du code pour le faire. Cela complique certaines choses et en simplifie d&#39;autres: il est facile d&#39;avoir quelque de math√©matique, g√©om√©trique et ordonn√© mais plus difficile d&#39;avoir quelque chose de chaotique et organique.</p>\n<p>Au final, j&#39;ai revisit√© mon baggage de techniques explor√©es ces pr√©c√©dentes ann√©es. Certaines techniques ont √©t√© √©tendues, de nouvelles primitives ont √©t√© d√©velopp√©s,... <strong>Voici quelques primitives notables que l&#39;on peut retrouver:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Les particules de <em>&quot;Storm&quot;</em> (<a href=\"/plots/394\">/plots/394</a>, <a href=\"/plots/312\">/plots/312</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/plots/394-thumbnail.jpg\" /><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/plots/312-thumbnail.jpg\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Les &quot;t√™tes&quot; comme la vid√©o pr√©c√©dente l&#39;a montr√©.

The sun strokes takes about 10 minutes but the rest takes around 100 minutes.</p>\n<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/164-plotting-speed-x200.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<h2 id=\"zoom-photos\">Zoom photos</h2>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/164zoom.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\n<h2 id=\"proof-of-plot-a-very-time-consuming-creation-process\">&quot;Proof of Plot&quot;, a very time-consuming creation process</h2>\n<p>The creation process of this plot loop was one of the most challenging one, among all of the other plots I have done so far. The fact each frame takes about 2 hours to plot with 2 manual actions (changing the fountain pens) makes any mistake very punishing! You can&#39;t faster the 2 hours much without risking the paper to suffer faced to the number of stroke of the fountain pen!</p>\n<h3 id=\"fail-and-retry\">Fail and retry</h3>\n<p>Yet, plotting is a fail and retry process, so I like to show you 2 failures first among 4 of my first prototype fails:</p>\n<p><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/plots/164-fail1.jpg\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/plots/164-fail2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For anyone familiar with plot and fountain pens this is indeed one of the worse nightmare to deal with: too much stroke-crowded area is going to badly end up with literally digging through the paper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quick-technique-to-solve-this-problem\">Quick technique to solve this problem</h3>\n<p>A very simple technique I call the &quot;passage counter&quot; technique. It&#39;s simply the use of a 2D Grid where each cell have a counter that you increment when a line goes through it, when it reaches 3 (or more) that&#39;s where you start raising the pen in these crowded area.</p>\n<img width=\"300px\" src=\"/images/plots/164-grid.png\">\n\n<p>It works great with the limitation that too much up and down of your pen is both time consuming but also can be hurting the paper too, there there is a tradeoff to find.</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-interesting-creative-coding-techniques-used\">Some interesting creative coding techniques used</h3>\n<h4 id=\"sun-rays-projection\">sun rays projection</h4>\n<p>For the sun rays, I&#39;ve used a simple radial projection that collides with the mountain lines.\nI had to make lines randomly starting at different places to avoid the effect to be too condensed at the beginning (problem of radial projection is your lines get more and more distanced). I wanted it to not be that &quot;random&quot; so i&#39;ve used a simple prime number formula: distance to center of sun is added of an extra <code>8. + ((i * 29) % 121) as f64</code> where <code>i</code> is the ray index.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sun-oscillation\">sun oscillation</h4>\n<p>I didn&#39;t wanted to make the sun motion too realistic but I wanted a visible motion that would fit with the mountains and project rays from different positions.

It creates more &quot;local minima&quot; on the shape and creates a more interesting animation.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s important to also note that noise/perlin noise, is quite challenging to &quot;loop&quot; and the way I did this is interpolation between 3 states.
