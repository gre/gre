As many of my previous plots, this is a 2-pass spiral parametric function, displaced with perlin noise warpped into each other (see &quot;domain warping&quot;). The spiral ends up being unstable and &quot;breaks apart&quot; with intentional glitches: the line is stopped as soon as two datapoints are to far from each other, as a spiral get bigger and bigger it inevitably ending up breaking apart completely in various places which combined with the parametric function makes some sort of humano√Ød shape!</p>\n<p>I sent some video while it was getting plotted. It started from the middle and the beginning is quite interesting and could itself be made a standalone. All of these are very exploratory and may be revisited later!</p>\n","data":{"title":"Warp Glitch 01","thumbnail":"/images/plots/152.jpg","description":"This is a fresh experimentation of noise domain warping with glitches","tweet":"https://twitter.com/greweb/status/1399823206215831556","tags":["noise"]}},"next":{"n":"154","key":"./154/README.md","rustFile":"154/main.rs","content":"<p>Definitely overkill, but this is implemented with &#39;box&#39; distance function of a square and marching squaring it with noise displacement.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Rounded squares","thumbnail":"/images/plots/154.jpg","description":"Definitely overkill, but this is implemented with 'box' distance function of a square and marching squaring it with noise displacement.","tags":["squares"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
