I started plotting on January 1 on a daily cycle, so let&#39;s celebrate this 200th plot. I&#39;m using here a very similar technique as explored in <a href=\"/plots/198\">plots#198</a> with even more tight lines and different settings used in combination with a coffee cup photo.</p>\n<p>This plot is a tribute to artist <em>Sean M Puckett</em> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck\">@PhotoPluck</a> on Twitter), who I consider an incredible artist of the plotting scene. They are frequently releasing impressive photo-driven plots, pushing the boundaries of what can be done with fountain pens. Please check their work on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck\">https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck</a>.</p>\n<p>I like their regular &quot;Monday coffee plot&quot; that I wanted to celebrate.</p>\n","data":{"date":"2021-07-18","title":"Monday coffee","image":"/images/plots/200.jpg","description":""}}},"__N_SSG":true}
