To achieved this, I organized the circles along a spiral from the center. The spiral is non linear (more stretched in the middle) to get a better concentration on the center. I enforced a padding to make sure there is a ~ constant space inside the main circle ring. The work is all made with 3 primitives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circle</strong> (stroked with circles, filled with spiral)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke</strong> (stroked with lines, possibly multiple line to get different stroke widths)</li>\n<li><strong>Ray</strong> which gives this &quot;spot light&quot; effect of the yellow and turquoise polygons. They are filled with rays lines. The exterior line is doubled to create a bit of outline effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a preview of other outcomes that could also have been plotted:</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-preview.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The generator was live coded on Twitch and a first prototype was plotted (with some failure on the first try ðŸ˜‚)</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-twitch.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The big challenge was to get the line distance right for the physical inks. It&#39;s very difficult because you get different ink flow from one ink to another.</p>\n<p>From the live plotted failed try, I adjusted the line distance and changed pink into a dark blue and finally managed to get a nice outcome:</p>\n<p><video loop controls src=\"/images/plots/643-real-time.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z1.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z2.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z3.jpg\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Kandinsky circle study","image":"/images/plots/643.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge"]}},{"n":"637","key":"./637/README.md","rustFile":"634/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/634/main.rs","content":"<p>Many spirals are stacked on top of each other with a variation of rotation and position.</p>\n<p>Testing a new ink: ina-ho iroshibu</p>\n","data":{"title":"WCCC: Spiral (4/4)","image":"/images/plots/637.jpg","sourceFolder":634,"tags":["wccchallenge"]}},{"n":"636","key":"./636/README.md","rustFile":"634/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/634/main.rs","content":"<p>Many spirals are stacked on top of each other with a variation of rotation and position.</p>\n<p>Testing a new ink: Sailor Seiboku</p>\n","data":{"title":"WCCC: Spiral (3/4)","image":"/images/plots/636.jpg","sourceFolder":634,"tags":["wccchallenge"]}},{"n":"635","key":"./635/README.md","rustFile":"634/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/634/main.rs","content":"<p>Many spirals are stacked on top of each other with a variation of rotation and position.</p>\n<p>Testing a new ink: Diamine Skull &amp; Roses in a fountain pen on A4 watercolor paper.</p>\n<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/635timelapse.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/635photo.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/635z.jpg\"/>\n\n<p>Alternative photo with another light orientation:</p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/635alt.jpg\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parameters of the generator: <code>seed: 2, amount: 10</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n","data":{"title":"WCCC: Spiral (2/4)","image":"/images/plots/635.jpg","sourceFolder":634,"tweet":"https://twitter.com/greweb/status/1560939131806662656","tags":["wccchallenge"]}},{"n":"634","key":"./634/README.md","rustFile":"634/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/634/main.rs","content":"<p><em>Honk honk!</em></p>\n<p>Many spirals are stacked on top of each other with a variation of rotation and position.</p>\n<p>This quick experiment is an entry for the &quot;Spiral&quot; theme of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sableRaph\">@sableraph</a>&#39;s weekly generative art challenge. 2 plots were made (634 and 635).</p>\n<p><em>Don&#39;t be afraid to open the source code :)</em></p>\n<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/634timelapse.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>Robert Oster Fire &amp; Ice ink in a fountain pen on A4 watercolor paper.</p>\n","data":{"title":"WCCC: Spiral (1/4)","image":"/images/plots/634.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge"]}},{"n":"620","key":"./620/README.md","rustFile":"615/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/615/main.rs","content":"<p>Calligraphy black on white paper.</p>\n<p>I let it glitched on this one, we can see the brush pattern.</p>\n<p><em>honk honk, that&#39;s it folks!</em></p>\n","data":{"title":"Simple Towers 6","image":"/images/plots/620.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge","brush"],"sourceFolder":615}},{"n":"619","key":"./619/README.md","rustFile":"615/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/615/main.rs","content":"<p>A monolithic tower.</p>\n<p>Calligraphy black on white paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"620\">next plot</a></p>\n","data":{"title":"Simple Towers 5","image":"/images/plots/619.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge","brush"],"sourceFolder":615}},{"n":"618","key":"./618/README.md","rustFile":"615/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/615/main.rs","content":"<p>Calligraphy black on white paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"619\">next plot</a></p>\n","data":{"title":"Simple Towers 4","image":"/images/plots/618.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge","brush"],"sourceFolder":615}},{"n":"617","key":"./617/README.md","rustFile":"615/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/615/main.rs","content":"<p>Calligraphy black on red paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"618\">next plot</a></p>\n","data":{"title":"Simple Towers 3","image":"/images/plots/617.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge","brush"],"sourceFolder":615}},{"n":"616","key":"./616/README.md","rustFile":"615/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/615/main.rs","content":"<p>This one uses signo broad white gel pen on blue paper.
