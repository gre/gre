At the end I stayed on my first ink choice but I will revisit this idea.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/plots/150-proto2.jpg\" width=\"57%\"><img src=\"/images/plots/150-proto2-zoom.jpg\" width=\"42.8%\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"process-to-find-the-final-plot\">Process to find the final plot</h2>\n<p>To search for the good parameters I&#39;ve used a generator script with bash for loops. It kinda looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">for a in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor b in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor c in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor d in 0.5 1 2 4; do\n  sh $P/gen.sh --a $a --b $b --c $c --d $d\n  cp ./results/out.gif out/${a}_${b}_${c}_${d}.gif\ndone\ndone\ndone\ndone\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I kept refining my &quot;range&quot; by fail and retry. It is quite slow to generate them so it&#39;s a long process.</p>\n<p>When I was satisfied by the parameters, I then switch to a second selection: the selection of the seed! because my noise have seed and can generate very different kind of noises, I put it against my &quot;elector&quot; homemade tool as explained on <a href=\"/plots/143\">plot#143</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-selection.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h2 id=\"some-highlight-of-the-rustlang-code\">Some highlight of the Rustlang code</h2>\n<p>There is nothing really &quot;new&quot; from my previous plots, especially all the parametric plot when I started this &quot;growing parametric&quot; exploration between <a href=\"/plots/114\">plot#114</a> and <a href=\"/plots/148\">plot#148</a>.</p>\n<p>What is new here however is the use of a GIF as an input. It&#39;s very easy to do: my script takes basically an loop percentage which I can transpose to looking up a frame in the rotating dancer loop. I can then use this function I&#39;ve just added to my utilities:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">use image::AnimationDecoder;\nuse image::RgbaImage;\nuse image::gif::GifDecoder;\nuse image::io::Reader as ImageReader;\n\npub fn image_gif_get_color(\n    path: &amp;str,\n    index: usize\n) -&gt; Result&lt;\n    impl Fn((f64, f64)) -&gt; (f64, f64, f64),\n    image::ImageError,\n&gt; {\n    let file_in = File::open(path)?;\n    let decoder = GifDecoder::new(file_in).unwrap();\n    let frames = decoder.into_frames();\n    let frames = frames.collect_frames()?;\n    let img = frames.get(index % frames.len()).unwrap();\n    let buffer = img.buffer();\n    return Ok(dynamic_image_get_color(buffer.clone()));\n}\n\npub fn dynamic_image_get_color(\n    img: RgbaImage\n) -&gt; impl Fn((f64, f64)) -&gt; (f64, f64, f64) {\n    let (width, height) = img.dimensions();\n    return move |(x, y): (f64, f64)| {\n        let xi = (x.max(0.0).min(1.0)\n            * ((width - 1) as f64)) as u32;\n        let yi = (y.max(0.0).min(1.0)\n            * ((height - 1) as f64))\n            as u32;\n        let pixel = img.get_pixel(xi, yi);\n        let r = (pixel[0] as f64) / 255.0;\n        let g = (pixel[1] as f64) / 255.0;\n        let b = (pixel[2] as f64) / 255.0;\n        return (r, g, b);\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Rust really shines in having great library, this is just the classical &quot;image&quot; package here.</p>\n<p>Apart from this, the Rust code (you can see main.rs link on top of this page) is pretty straightforward.
