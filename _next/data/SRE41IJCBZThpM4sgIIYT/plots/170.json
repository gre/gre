The main digital art is a 1920p video loop of 8 frames available as a <a href=\"https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/144002\">Tezos hicetnunc NFT</a>. The physical art is 8 frames of A4 size, plotted with a black fountain pen on 300 g/m2 grain paper, and offered when <a href=\"https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/144002\">buying the NFT</a> (8 editions, assigned in buy order).</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/171zoom1.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>The name &#39;Ring of faces&#39; refers to generating different silhouettes of faces from pure noise. The work involved here is purely generative art (nothing draw manually). I had a selection phase where I chose this one among 100 results.</p>\n<p>I like these eight plots series because there are many unique faces here. You can even imagine faces in the inner area. That is purely a reflection of your own imagination.</p>\n<p>I also played a lot with this duality to put twice the art in inversed coloring filling mode as well as having a rotation. The animation between the two tiles is offset exactly by 50% while also allowing a good variety and similarity when you buy one specific frame.</p>\n<p>I used a high grain paper this time which works well with the cross-hatching filling method used, also thanks to a not too crowded area. I usually would avoid such paper for fountain pens that can &quot;bleed&quot; too much on it. It&#39;s time to do it more in the future!</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/171zoom2.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>The general animation is inspired by a shader I wrote <a href=\"https://greweb.me/shaderday/68\">https://greweb.me/shaderday/68</a></p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/171all.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>The effect called &#39;Apophenia&#39; is, in this case, our ability to recognize a face silhouette in pure noise.</p>\n<p>I see these different silhouettes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an indigenous face</li>\n<li>Churchill</li>\n<li>a bearded man</li>\n<li>a woman</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go figure why.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Ring of faces (8 frames)","thumbnail":"/images/plots/171.gif","description":"8 frames plotted making an animated loop.
