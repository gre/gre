One of the usual challenge I had to face is the fact many strokes were placed at the same area and had risk to dig into the paper. I&#39;ve used my usual &#39;grid counter&#39; technique but this time pushed it to extreme in that it started making &quot;dots&quot; a bit like in the stippling technique. Dots are aligned to the grid that is used by the algorithm.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/178plotting0.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>I then met one of the biggest difficulty of my plot: the fact the paper will start waving a bit with the humidity of the ink.
