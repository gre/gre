The angle is initially pointing up but on each iteration, it gets randomly offset by a random value. That&#39;s where the random number generator (RNG) happens: a value of 0.0 means (go left) a value of 0.5 keep moving forward and a value of 1.0 (go right).</p>\n<p>The funny part about the RNG at stake here is that it&#39;s implemented like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let mut rng_v = i / count; // value from 0 to 1, unique for each line\nlet mut custom_rng = || {\n    rng_v = rng_v + PI;\n    rng_v % 1.0\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>this basically is just translating a value by PI and keeping the fractional part ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>this is actually almost like a sawtooth signal with a small offset. <strong>sawtooth that creates the oscillation effect on the line</strong> and the small offset makes a lower frequency waving effect of the lines.</p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/211411/151678315-f3f7a895-ecb3-4d8e-8bc5-9fc62255a33c.png\">\n\n<p><strong>What i&#39;m trying to prove here is that despite the very not random RNG, I still managed to get a result that appears to be random.</strong></p>\n<p>was live coded and live plotted on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/greweb\">https://twitch.tv/greweb</a></p>\n","data":{"title":"PI RNG","thumbnail":"/images/plots/392.jpg"}},"prev":{"n":"391","key":"./391/README.md","rustFile":"391/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/391/main.rs","content":"<p>This was implemented for <a href=\"https://genuary.art\">genuary.art</a> &quot;Abstract vegetation&quot; of JAN.23.</p>\n<p>Made another version:</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/391b.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>was live coded and live plotted on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/greweb\">https://twitch.tv/greweb</a></p>\n","data":{"title":"Abstract vegetation","thumbnail":"/images/plots/391.jpg"}},"next":null},"__N_SSG":true}
