To achieved this, I organized the circles along a spiral from the center. The spiral is non linear (more stretched in the middle) to get a better concentration on the center. I enforced a padding to make sure there is a ~ constant space inside the main circle ring. The work is all made with 3 primitives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circle</strong> (stroked with circles, filled with spiral)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke</strong> (stroked with lines, possibly multiple line to get different stroke widths)</li>\n<li><strong>Ray</strong> which gives this &quot;spot light&quot; effect of the yellow and turquoise polygons. They are filled with rays lines. The exterior line is doubled to create a bit of outline effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a preview of other outcomes that could also have been plotted:</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-preview.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The generator was live coded on Twitch and a first prototype was plotted (with some failure on the first try ðŸ˜‚)</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-twitch.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The big challenge was to get the line distance right for the physical inks. It&#39;s very difficult because you get different ink flow from one ink to another.</p>\n<p>From the live plotted failed try, I adjusted the line distance and changed pink into a dark blue and finally managed to get a nice outcome:</p>\n<p><video loop controls src=\"/images/plots/643-real-time.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z1.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z2.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z3.jpg\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Kandinsky circle study","date":"2022-08-22","image":"/images/plots/643.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge"]}},"prev":{"n":"642","key":"./642/README.md","rustFile":"642/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/642/main.rs","content":"<p>inks: Diamine Pumpkin + Diamine Sargasso Sea</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/642.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n","data":{"date":"2022-08-22","title":"Vitraux (proto 5)","image":"/images/plots/642.jpg","tags":["vitraux"]}},"next":{"n":"644","key":"./644/README.md","rustFile":"link","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-mountain-moons","content":"<p>Plot physically collected by the NFT owner.</p>\n<p>Plotted during a live stream on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/greweb\">https://twitch.tv/greweb</a></p>\n","data":{"date":"2022-09-01","title":"Mountain Moons #100","image":"/images/plots/644.jpg","sourceFolderURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-mountain-moons","sourceFolder":"plottable-mountain-moons","nftGenerator":"https://www.fxhash.xyz/gentk/91070","tags":["plottable-mountain-moons"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
