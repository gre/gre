To achieved this, I organized the circles along a spiral from the center. The spiral is non linear (more stretched in the middle) to get a better concentration on the center. I enforced a padding to make sure there is a ~ constant space inside the main circle ring. The work is all made with 3 primitives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circle</strong> (stroked with circles, filled with spiral)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke</strong> (stroked with lines, possibly multiple line to get different stroke widths)</li>\n<li><strong>Ray</strong> which gives this &quot;spot light&quot; effect of the yellow and turquoise polygons. They are filled with rays lines.
