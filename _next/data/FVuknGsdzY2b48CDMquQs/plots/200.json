I started plotting on January 1 on a daily cycle, so let&#39;s celebrate this 200th plot. I&#39;m using here a very similar technique as explored in <a href=\"/plots/198\">plots#198</a> with even more tight lines and different settings used in combination with a coffee cup photo.</p>\n<p>This plot is a tribute to artist <em>Sean M Puckett</em> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck\">@PhotoPluck</a> on Twitter), who I consider an incredible artist of the plotting scene. They are frequently releasing impressive photo-driven plots, pushing the boundaries of what can be done with fountain pens.
