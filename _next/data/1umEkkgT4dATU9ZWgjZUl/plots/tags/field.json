They all have the same inital price and the physical piece is selected in order of buy as each frame is relatively similar!</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-plots.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>This is a reboot of <a href=\"/plots/148\">plot#148</a> but with a big rework of the noise technique using domain warping as well as combination with this famous &#39;rotating dancer&#39; GIF.</p>\n<p>It is plotted with two phases, a first pass without a lot of noise and a second pass with more noise divergence:</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-phases.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-zoom1.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-zoom2.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-zoom3.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h2 id=\"early-prototype-in-pursuit-of-the-good-ink-and-paper\">Early prototype, in pursuit of the good ink and paper...</h2>\n<p>I started with this first prototype of the concept:</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-proto1.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<p>It allowed me to see what I could adjust, for instance: adding more noise, more lines and scaling a bit the dancer.</p>\n<p>I used ink &#39;Quink&#39; by Parker plotted with a fountain pen on a Canson Bristol 250g paper (A4 format).</p>\n<p>Here is another prototype I tried: it uses a mix of two colors (dragon red and turquoise). <strong>I ended up preferring minimalism: black on white. At the end I stayed on my first ink choice but I will revisit this idea.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/plots/150-proto2.jpg\" width=\"57%\"><img src=\"/images/plots/150-proto2-zoom.jpg\" width=\"42.8%\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"process-to-find-the-final-plot\">Process to find the final plot</h2>\n<p>To search for the good parameters I&#39;ve used a generator script with bash for loops. It kinda looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">for a in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor b in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor c in 0.5 1 2 4; do\nfor d in 0.5 1 2 4; do\n  sh $P/gen.sh --a $a --b $b --c $c --d $d\n  cp ./results/out.gif out/${a}_${b}_${c}_${d}.gif\ndone\ndone\ndone\ndone\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I kept refining my &quot;range&quot; by fail and retry. It is quite slow to generate them so it&#39;s a long process.</p>\n<p>When I was satisfied by the parameters, I then switch to a second selection: the selection of the seed! because my noise have seed and can generate very different kind of noises, I put it against my &quot;elector&quot; homemade tool as explained on <a href=\"/plots/143\">plot#143</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/150-selection.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n<h2 id=\"some-highlight-of-the-rustlang-code\">Some highlight of the Rustlang code</h2>\n<p>There is nothing really &quot;new&quot; from my previous plots, especially all the parametric plot when I started this &quot;growing parametric&quot; exploration between <a href=\"/plots/114\">plot#114</a> and <a href=\"/plots/148\">plot#148</a>.</p>\n<p>What is new here however is the use of a GIF as an input. It&#39;s very easy to do: my script takes basically an loop percentage which I can transpose to looking up a frame in the rotating dancer loop. I can then use this function I&#39;ve just added to my utilities:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">use image::AnimationDecoder;\nuse image::RgbaImage;\nuse image::gif::GifDecoder;\nuse image::io::Reader as ImageReader;\n\npub fn image_gif_get_color(\n    path: &amp;str,\n    index: usize\n) -&gt; Result&lt;\n    impl Fn((f64, f64)) -&gt; (f64, f64, f64),\n    image::ImageError,\n&gt; {\n    let file_in = File::open(path)?;\n    let decoder = GifDecoder::new(file_in).unwrap();\n    let frames = decoder.into_frames();\n    let frames = frames.collect_frames()?;\n    let img = frames.get(index % frames.len()).unwrap();\n    let buffer = img.buffer();\n    return Ok(dynamic_image_get_color(buffer.clone()));\n}\n\npub fn dynamic_image_get_color(\n    img: RgbaImage\n) -&gt; impl Fn((f64, f64)) -&gt; (f64, f64, f64) {\n    let (width, height) = img.dimensions();\n    return move |(x, y): (f64, f64)| {\n        let xi = (x.max(0.0).min(1.0)\n            * ((width - 1) as f64)) as u32;\n        let yi = (y.max(0.0).min(1.0)\n            * ((height - 1) as f64))\n            as u32;\n        let pixel = img.get_pixel(xi, yi);\n        let r = (pixel[0] as f64) / 255.0;\n        let g = (pixel[1] as f64) / 255.0;\n        let b = (pixel[2] as f64) / 255.0;\n        return (r, g, b);\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Rust really shines in having great library, this is just the classical &quot;image&quot; package here.</p>\n<p>Apart from this, the Rust code (you can see main.rs link on top of this page) is pretty straightforward. There is just a lot of work in the parametric function which starts to be quite big:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">let parametric = |p: f64| {\n    let p1 = (splits * p).floor();\n    let p2 = splits * p - p1;\n    let t = (p1 + split_threshold * p2) / splits;\n    let mut t2 = (p1\n        + split_threshold * p2.powf(pow))\n        / splits;\n    let initial = 1. / spins;\n    t2 =\n        (t2 - initial).max(0.) / (1. - initial);\n    let scale = 1.0\n        - t2 * (1.0\n            - i as f64 * opts.size_diff / size);\n    let s = spins;\n    let mut p = (\n        scale\n            * amp1\n            * ((s * 2. * PI * t).sin()\n                + amp2\n                    * mix(\n                        (s * f1.1 * PI * t).sin(),\n                        (s * f2.1 * PI * t).sin(),\n                        t,\n                    )),\n        0.07\n        - scale\n            * amp1\n            * ((s * 2. * PI * t).cos()\n                + amp2\n                    * mix(\n                        (s * f1.0 * PI * t).cos(),\n                        (s * f2.0 * PI * t).cos(),\n                        t,\n                    )),\n    );\n    let noise_angle = p.1.atan2(p.0);\n    let noise_amp = 0.003 * perlin.get([\n            opts.a * (progress * PI).sin() +\n            4.8 * p.0 + perlin.get([\n                7.8 * p.0,\n                4.2 * p.1 + opts.b * (progress * PI).sin(),\n                40. + opts.seed\n            ]),\n            4.8 * p.1 + 0.8 * perlin.get([\n                4.5 * p.0 + opts.c * ((1. - progress) * PI).sin(),\n                6.8 * p.1 + perlin.get([\n                    20.5 * p.0 + opts.d * (2. * PI * progress).cos(),\n                    20.8 * p.1,\n                    200. + opts.seed,\n                ]),\n                20. + opts.seed,\n            ]),\n            100. + opts.seed + i as f64 * opts.seed_diff,\n        ]) +\n        0.03 * (1. - t) * perlin.get([\n            0.7 * p.0 + perlin.get([\n                2.9 * p.0 + opts.e * (2. * PI * progress).cos(),\n                1.7 * p.1,\n                2000.0\n            ]),\n            0.7 * p.1 + perlin.get([\n                3.1 * p.0,\n                2.5 * p.1 + opts.e * (2. * PI * progress).sin(),\n                2100.0\n            ]),\n            1000.,\n        ]);\n\n    p.0 += noise_amp * noise_angle.cos();\n    p.1 += noise_amp * noise_angle.sin();\n    p\n};\n</code></pre>\n","data":{"title":"Dancing Planet","image":"/images/plots/150.gif","description":"8 frames plotted making an animated loop.
