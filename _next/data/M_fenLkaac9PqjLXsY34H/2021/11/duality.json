It is trustless and fully opened like hicetnunc was. Despite being in a beta state, there is already a decent UX and DX (developer experience): The developer onboarding might be one of the best among all the generative art platform I&#39;ve been able to test. Without contacting anyone, I was able to publish my first generator. You get guided interactively and end to end from testing your generator, snapshotting the preview and signing transactions to publish it. It is completely trustless and autonomous.</p>\n<p><strong>Beware the platform is still barely working due to heavy load from the community trying to jump into it.</strong></p>\n<p>This weekend, I released a variant of one of my &quot;shaderday&quot; to make &quot;Wave&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wave by @greweb – <a href=\"https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/67\">https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/67</a></p>\n<p><video src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/wave.mp4\" width=\"60%\" controls autoplay muted loop></video></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will now release a new generator called &#39;Duality&#39; – heavily inspired from <a href=\"https://greweb.me/shaderday/65\">https://greweb.me/shaderday/65</a> but with a lot of variety of results and loop possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"duality\">Duality</h2>\n<p>will appear soon on <a href=\"https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/greweb\">https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/greweb</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Duality is a minimalistic loop of circles and squares jumping between dark and light sides. wide variety of effects using repetitions, polar modulus, disc and squares. There are very rare cases implemented that may be revealed over mints! A generalization of my &quot;Jumping Blob&quot; creation – develop in 2021 under water by @greweb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/a.gif\"/>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/b.gif\"/><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/c.gif\"/>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/d.gif\"/><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/e.gif\"/>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/f.gif\"/><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/g.gif\"/>\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/h.gif\"/><img width=\"50%\" src=\"/images/2021/11/duality/i.gif\"/>\n","data":{"title":"fxhash: duality","thumbnail":"/images/2021/11/duality/a.gif","description":"Releasing a generative art on fxhash","tags":["NFT"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
