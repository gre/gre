I initially thought about only rendering spirals for the leaf cases of the recursion but after accidentally enabling the effect for all, I found it even more interesting to go into this moiré effect and the spiral density accumulation. The recursion have 10% chance to stop at each level, as well as a spiral have 10% change to only render a simple circle, to let the background shine through.</p>\n<p><strong>The beauty of plotting is that, even though the idea and the digital version is relatively simple, the physical execution have a lot of random factors that can make each plot really unique.</strong> In the present case, I had random line failures as well as pen not lifting up properly in other cases.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/1077z.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />","data":{"date":"2023-04-20","title":"Lunar","image":"/images/plots/1077.jpg","frDescription":"création issue d'un générateur basé sur un algorithme récursive, qui pave l'espace de cercles. chaque cercle est dessiné avec une spirale.
