This physical art digitalized back into a loop is itself unique in analog details.</li>\n<li>It is immortalized back into an NFT and gifted to the collector as well. Such &quot;physical plot loop&quot; NFT can have its own life aside of the initial recipe. Interestingly, the recipe is digital-only VS the physical plot loop will have the physical medium speaking.</li>\n</ul>\n","data":{"title":"Circleception #63","image":"/images/plots/547.gif","video":"/images/plots/547.mp4","sourceFolderURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-loop-circleception","nft":"https://objkt.com/asset/KT1AZYsEjt8HFEXWZUjGVfBxtzKPobNo3x1t/7","tags":["plotloop","circleception"]}},"next":{"n":"549","key":"./549/README.md","rustFile":"549/main.rs","sourceURL":"https://github.com/gre/gre/blob/master/plots/examples/549/main.rs","content":"<p><video loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/549vid.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>Lines are getting plotted with fountain pen on watercolor paper. The yellow is overlapping on top of the red color, I wanted to see if the ink would actually &quot;bleed&quot; and fade from the red to yellow but it didn&#39;t happen, however we have interesting effect at the &quot;end&quot; of the lines (plotting from left to right) because the ink accumulates more on ends. I wanted to see how the medium expresses in a very minimalistic plot. Lines are drawn each 0.3 millimeters and the fountain pen stroke width is approximatively of 0.35 millimeters.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/plots/549z.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<img src=\"/images/plots/549z2.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Rougejaune","image":"/images/plots/549.jpg"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
