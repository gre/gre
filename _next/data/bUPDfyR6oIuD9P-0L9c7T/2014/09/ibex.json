They are managed in JavaScript and behaves with an AI.\nThe pixels collision and the ibex decisions (e.g; react on fire nearby) is based on querying the simulated world (stored in the GPU as a texture).</p>\n<p>The rendering of the game is also performed in WebGL through another shader (<code>render.frag</code>).\nMy source code is <a href=\"http://github.com/gre/js13k-2014\">on Github</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>I will try to write a technical post-mortem to explain you more of this \nand also what went wrong and what could have been more efficient in my usage of WebGL.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h2>\n<p>During my early development, I&#39;ve experimented the fire propagation in deep forest:</p>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"440\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YU_pYAauFo4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n","data":{"title":"IBEX, my js13k game","description":"IBEX is a game made in 13k of JavaScript code made for the js13kgames one-month contest.","thumbnail":"/images/2014/09/ibex.png","author":"Gaetan","layout":"post","tags":["gamedev","js13k"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
