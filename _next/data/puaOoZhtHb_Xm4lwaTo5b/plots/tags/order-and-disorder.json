This explores the minimalism of achieving figurative work using only very simple primitives like squares and polygons. There is a balance between object packing and object clipping and a search of harmony between shape alignment and collisions. There are different kind of filling techniques as well as many different kind of foreground and background elements that may arise, each having different probability.</p>\n<p>While the display is provided digitally with animation effects, it is also greatly appreciated when physically plotted: In fact, each item is physical plottable with pens, designed to be on A3 format.</p>\n<!--\nIf you own one, you can request a physical edition too (see conditions at [https://greweb.me/plots/nft](https://greweb.me/plots/nft)) – The NFT is ultimately the recipe to a physically plottable art piece, it exports a SVG that you can plot with pens – plotter artists are free to use their own materials and ship to collectors as long as the NFT is owned at the time of the request. Simply drag&drop (or right-click-save) in a folder to get the .SVG.\n-->\n","data":{"imageheight":500,"nftcollection":{"desc":"Owning a Order and Disorder NFT?","ctaLink":"https://greweb.me/plots/nft?ethereum","cta":"Request a physical edition"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
