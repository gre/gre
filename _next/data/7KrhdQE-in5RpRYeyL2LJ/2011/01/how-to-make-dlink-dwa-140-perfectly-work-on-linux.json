Use wpa_supplicant utils like netcfg instead of ! </p>\n<h2 id=\"procedure\">Procedure</h2>\n<p>Alternatives rejected, here is the solution step by step :</p>\n<h3 id=\"pre-conditions\">Pre-conditions</h3>\n<p>With a wired connection, install these packages (with your package manager) : <strong>ndiswrapper</strong>, <strong>wpa_supplicant</strong> and (optional) <strong>netcfg</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I had some freeze issues with the current ndiswrapper repository version so I checkout ndiswrapper SVN source code on  and recompile it. <strong>Maybe you have to do the same.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li> Don’t plug your bundle yet. Insert the CD of the product. It contains the driver we need for ndiswrapper. You need to find the <code>/Drivers/WinXPx64/</code> (it may depend on your arch) <strong>.inf</strong> file. You can also download the last driver on the <a href=\"http://www.dlink.com/products/?tab=3&amp;pid=DWA-140&amp;rev=DWA-140_revB\">D-Link website</a>.</li>\n<li> Go on commandline in root mode and type:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ndiswrapper -i {path of the .inf file}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ndiswrapper -i /media/cdrom0/Drivers/WinXPx64/Drt2870.inf\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Plug your bundle and check if the command <code>ndiswrapper -l</code> say something like: </li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>drt2870 : driver installed  \ndevice (07D1:3C0A) present\n</code></pre>\n<p>If not you maybe need to <code>ndiswrapper -r drt2870</code> to remove the driver and return to the second step trying another <code>/Drivers/*/*.inf</code> file. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>  Next, you need to configure your <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> configuration file for  your wifi access point. Refer to the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant\">documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>  Try to run <code>wpa_supplicant</code> : </li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this working, you maybe need to run dhcpd :</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">dhcpd wlan0\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>  Now you can try your internet connection, by pinging google.com or try to browse the web.</li>\n<li>If it works, you can save your configuration, refer to the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA_supplicant\">documentation</a>. </li>\n<li><em>For any problem, feel free to comment this article.</em>*</li>\n</ul>\n","data":{"title":"How to make DLink DWA-140 B2 perfectly work on Linux","author":"Gaetan","layout":"post","permalink":"/2011/01/how-to-make-dlink-dwa-140-perfectly-work-on-linux/","tags":["linux"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
