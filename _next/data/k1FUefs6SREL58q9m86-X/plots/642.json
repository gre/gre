To achieved this, I organized the circles along a spiral from the center. The spiral is non linear (more stretched in the middle) to get a better concentration on the center. I enforced a padding to make sure there is a ~ constant space inside the main circle ring. The work is all made with 3 primitives: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circle</strong> (stroked with circles, filled with spiral)</li>\n<li><strong>Stroke</strong> (stroked with lines, possibly multiple line to get different stroke widths)</li>\n<li><strong>Ray</strong> which gives this &quot;spot light&quot; effect of the yellow and turquoise polygons. They are filled with rays lines. The exterior line is doubled to create a bit of outline effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a preview of other outcomes that could also have been plotted:</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-preview.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The generator was live coded on Twitch and a first prototype was plotted (with some failure on the first try ðŸ˜‚)</p>\n<p><video muted loop autoplay controls src=\"/images/plots/643-twitch.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<p>The big challenge was to get the line distance right for the physical inks. It&#39;s very difficult because you get different ink flow from one ink to another.</p>\n<p>From the live plotted failed try, I adjusted the line distance and changed pink into a dark blue and finally managed to get a nice outcome:</p>\n<p><video loop controls src=\"/images/plots/643-real-time.mp4\" width=\"100%\"></video></p>\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z1.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z2.jpg\"/>\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"/images/plots/643z3.jpg\"/>\n","data":{"title":"Kandinsky circle study","date":"2022-08-22","image":"/images/plots/643.jpg","tags":["wccchallenge"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
