# Releasing **Relics**, my first curated NFT collectible series, on Tezos blockchain and platform [_hicetnunc.xyz_](https://hic.link/greweb).

**Collection:** There are 28 curated visual loops that will be shared on the 7 days of this week. 4 NFT a day. I will use French day names as well as French seasons to name them all.

**Technical:** Relics collection are unique animation made with Perlin noise, cellular automaton and GLSL. The generator is however fully Open Source and available on my website here: https://greweb.me/shaderday/63 as I strongly believe in open sourcing literally everything I do as an artist. I curated carefully the 28 unique NFTs myself and it's released under my name as artist.

> Contact me if you are the buyer to know what are the parameters of your NFT. Unfortunately it's not possible yet to "unlock" content as part of buying a NFT but I would be glad to give you the parameters of your NFT! I can also generate high resolution versions on demand (but also, the open sourced code allows it, once you have these parameters!).

## Monday Relics
