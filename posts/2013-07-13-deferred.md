# A [World Of Promises][0], episode 2

<img src="/images/2013/07/qimage_then_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail-right" style="width: 200px" />

*This second article on [Q][1] will introduce you how to easily 
turn a callback API into a promise API using Deferred objects.
It will also present the new W3C specification of Promise and finish
with the implementation of [Qimage][2], a simple Image Promise wrapper.*

## Deferred objects

[Q][1] splits the concept of Promise in two parts: one part is the **Deferred object**, another is the **Promise object**.

A **Deferred object** is an object which just aims to control the state of a Promise.
It allows to do one of the two following actions (one time only):

* `.resolve(value)`: moving from *pending* to ***fulfilled* with a value**.
* `.reject(error)`: moving from *pending* to ***rejected* with an error**.

<img src="/images/2013/07/promise.png" style="max-width: 300px; width: 100%" />

A **Promise object** can be obtained from a Deferred object via the `promise` field.
In [Q][1], a Promise is **read-only**: you can basically only do `.then` with it 
and there is no such `resolve` or `reject` method on a Promise.

 > a Deferred is "resolvable", a Promise is "thenable".

***N.B.***: *this separation also exists in other languages but with different names (for instance in Scala: Promise / Future).*

### `Q.defer()`

The method Q.defer() will return a new **Deferred object** initialized in a *pending* state.

```javascript
var d = Q.defer();
setTimeout(function () {
  d.resolve(42);
}, 500);
var promise = d.promise;
// ...
promise.then(function (value) {
  console.log("the universe = "+value);
});
```

Note that the [Promises/A][3] spec only specifies the concept of **Promise**.
It does not defines the "Deferred" part.
Up to the Promise library to implement its own way of resolving / rejecting the value of a Promise.

There is also [Promises/B][5] and [Promises/D][6] to define that though.

### About the DOM.Promise specification

a [new DOM specification draft][4] has born recently and is a bit different from the Q style,
the "Deferred" object (called a **Resolver**) is given as an argument of the function given at Promise instanciation.

```javascript
var promise = new /*DOM.*/Promise(function (resolver) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    resolver.resolve(42);
  }, 500);
});
promise.then(function (value) {
  console.log("the universe = "+value);
});
```

## Qimage: Wrapping the Image API

We will now show you how to easily **wrap the DOM Image API into a Promise API with Q**.
Before showing the implementation, let's explore the possibilities of such API.

**`Qimage (url: String) => Promise[DOM Image]`**

Here is how we want our `Qimage` API to look like:

```javascript
var promise = Qimage("http://imagesource.com/image.png");
promise.then(function (image) {
  // image instanceof Image
}, function (error) {
  // error instanceof Error
});
```

We can use it like this:

```javascript
Qimage("images/foo.png").then(function (img) {
  document.body.appendChild(img);
}, function (error) {
  document.body.innerHTML = "Unable to load the image";
});
```

Now we define `Qimage` as a Promise library, **we can then use all the power of Promises,
combine Promises together, chain different Promise APIs**...

```javascript
Q.all([
  Qimage("res1.png"),
  Qimage("res2.png"),
  Qimage("res3.png")
])
.spread(function (res1, res2, res3) {
  document.body.appendChild(res1);
  document.body.appendChild(res2);
  document.body.appendChild(res3);
});
```

This wrapper makes a simple but powerful Image Loading library module.

### Implementation

Here is how `Qimage` works:

```javascript
var Qimage = function (url) {
  var d = Q.defer();
  var img = new Image();
  img.onload = function () {
    d.resolve(img);
  };
  img.onabort = function (e) {
    d.reject(e);
  };
  img.onerror = function (err) {
    d.reject(err);
  };
  img.src = url;
  return d.promise;
};
```

...and that's it!

Note that **the Deferred object is isolated** in the `Qimage` function scope.

Only the (read-only) Promise is accessible from the outside when returned by the function.

**How simple is wrapping a callback API into a Promise API!**

[Qimage][2] is released as a micro-lib and available on [Github][2] and [NPM][7].

## Next episode

Next episode will feature **`requestAnimationFrame`**, 
*a fundamental function generally used for performing efficient Javascript animations*.
We will show you **QanimationFrame** and how we can use it as a **Promisified "wait for DOM to be ready" API**.
