> ðŸ¤— **The ethblock.art BlockStyle ['Pattern 03'](https://ethblock.art/style/32) sold out yesterday in only 2 hours with 888 pieces.** I still can't believe it. There are no words to describe how thankful I am for all your support. THANK YOU!

## What about the physical art?

Quick recap of the philosophy announced before the BlockStyle was released:

**Decoupling physical art from its digital form:** Not all digital NFT collectors also are physical collectors. It is therefore important to allow both to co-exist without having a limitation on any side.

**Openness and scalability of physical plotting**. The digital NFT have a "SVG" button on hover which allow to download the SVG file (right click, download). The SVG format is a vectorial format that is used to define all the "paths" of drawing. It is the recipe to plots. That way, this is truly scalable and decentralized. Like blockchain is. I am not necessarily the only one that can plot the work physically. It could be you. It could be another artist. This model allows it.

**An economy around the digital NFTs?**  In this decoupled model, 'Pattern 03' digital NFT are the main pivot NFTs at stake. an economy can be built around them. Physical artists can plot them, create & sell on side collection that allows the second market to grow. There are many ways this can be traded: for instance swapping the digital NFT as a currency is a possibility that would be recommended, but so is doing a more regular "selling print as a service"... Ultimately, the physical artist value their own skills, own "touch" â€“ a bit like a baker can sell baguettes with a shared recipe designed by ancestors.

## *"@greweb 'Pattern 03' plots"* collection

A collection [*"@greweb 'Pattern 03' plots"*](https://opensea.io/collection/greweb-pattern-03-plots) has been created on OpenSea.
It will curate plots that I will start drawing in the coming days.

It's going to be a time-consuming process as a plot takes about 1 hour to perform (depending on settings and complexity of the lines). The physical art is designed to be plotted with fountain pens on A4 water-colour 300g paper and then cut into a 21 by 21 centimeters piece with a 5mm padding (so your art is a 20x20cm square). The planned inks to use are those described by the "Ink" trait (Diamine inks). The digital NFT has simulated a rendering that will be relatively well respected. There is going to be unpredictability when plotting it for real.

> Disclaimer: Beware I will likely not be able to plot them all. There are 888 items and it takes an average 1 hour to plot. However, I'll start plotting following a bit this curation decision process:
> - personal favorite picks
> - I will look at Opensea most starred NFTs
> - I will look at Opensea most sold NFTs
> - also if you really want the physical piece. e.g. if you ask me on Discord / Twitter. I can sure take request and add it in the wished list But I can't guarantee it as it would probably takes me 800 hours =)

## First phase: ðŸŽ‰ claim a physical plot *before November 1st, 2021*

This first phase will ends on November 1st, 2021 for all physical NFTs. The presented offer will only be available during that time. The NFT physical I own after this time will still be owned by me and a second phase will be documented later.

**How will it work?**

You can claim a physical NFT (created on the collection shared above) **as long as you own the digital NFT**. 

To claim it, you make a small Offer on the NFT physical (pay what you want, e.g. 0.01 WETH) so I can verify you are the NFT digital owner & proceed to the NFT transfer of that 'physical NFT'.

You will then get a code to obtain it physically.

**How shipping works?**
- The 'physical NFT', once acquires, will have unlockable content with instructions on how to contact me for proceeding to shipping.
- **IMPORTANT: Please use a PO Box or other postal service ( e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poste_restante ). I do not want to know your home address, thanks.**
- On my side, I will use a simple (possibly tracked) letter to ship the 20x20cm art internationally.

## second phase?

**This phase is not yet planned and may happen if people are interested to these plots.**
