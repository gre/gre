# A [World Of Promises][0], episode 4

<img src="/images/2013/07/zanimo_animation_thumbnail.png" alt="" class="thumbnail-left" style="width: 200px" />

*This fourth article on [Q][1] will introduce [Zanimo.js][2], 
a Promisified animation library which helps to chain different
CSS transitions with only Promises.
It is very interoperable with any other Promise library,
meaning that you can easily chain Zanimo animations with other asynchronous actions.*

[Zanimo.js][2] is a smooth library developed by [@42loops][3] animation library based on the library [Q][4], a Javascript implementation of Promises.

This article is an introduction of the concept of Promises in Javascript with the library Q and will show a real use case of it: Promises used on top CSS Transitions to make powerful and efficient DOM animations in Javascript.
