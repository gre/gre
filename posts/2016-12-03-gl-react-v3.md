## gl-react has been rewritten from scratch

**gl-react v3 is a complete rewrite of the v2 implementation for better performance and compatibility with React paradigm.**

This is not yet published on NPM as it's [still in development][github] (the Web version is pretty ready, React Native version is not implemented).

Most features provided by gl-react v2 are preserved (API haven't changed, [see how similar is the HelloGL example](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/hellogl)), but v3 fixes most Github issues accumulated for a year.

### The biggest mistake of the previous implementation

If there is one lesson learned from previous gl-react implementation: **"unfolding" / consuming the `children` prop by yourself is (probably) wrong, let React solve this job!** Using React, you can benefit [React reconciliation and diff algorithm](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html).
In other words, always prefer to keep users' VDOM tree rather than consuming it with `React.Children.*` functions.

I feel dumb not having discovered this before, but if you are not actually rendering DOM it's an easy path for a library to just map, traverse, consume the children tree and just render what you needs (like just a `<canvas/>`). But this is probably a mistake! First, this makes it impossible to use React Devtools and see the original tree, but more importantly, it breaks interoperability with other libraries (e.g. don't forbid someone to use [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) or [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) in the middle of your components!).

A better idea is to preserve the user `children`. Keep your logic in each Component and use the React lifecycle to create and destroy things, and **use [React context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) to connect children to parent**.

> You should better keep user `children`, even if it means rendering it in an empty `<span>`, _current workaround of `gl-react`, looking forward to hearing from you, idea inspired from the great [react-music](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-music)_

### What it means for gl-react

The gl-react v3 implementation truly uses React lifecycle: **a React Component update triggers a GL redraw**. That way, `shouldComponentUpdate` allows to do partial GL re-rendering. Each Node holds a [framebuffer object](https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Framebuffer_Object) (created on mount, destroyed on unmount) that only get redrawn when component updates and schedules a Surface reflow.

`<Node>` receives the `gl: WebGLRenderingContext` from the ancestor `<Surface>` thanks to [React context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html). There is also a `glParent` context (a Surface or another Node) that is used to make GL components discoverable each other so we can build a dependency graph. This dependency graph allows to implement the correct `draw` pipeline (and it's pretty trivial, see [_Section "under the hood of Surface and Node redraw"_](#under_the_hook_redraw)).

## `<Bus>`, a better way to share computation

[gl-react used to automatically factorize the duplicates elements of the GL tree](http://greweb.me/2016/06/glreactconf/) but **it has been decided to remove this feature**: _This was actually a complex mechanism (a bit too "magic"), hard to implement and a premature optimization that can have slower performance._

The new gl-react embraces the React paradigm: The new way to express a Graph (and share computation) is **using a [`<Bus>`][bus]**...

### The `` `()=>ref` `` pattern

The problem we want to solve is to **express a graph with React**, which, at first glance, only allow to represent trees, not graphs!

The way we can solve this is by using refs and a "ref getter function":

1. **a Bus with a ref:** `<Bus ref="myBus">{content to inject}</Bus>`.
2. **pass a function that resolves the ref** to pipe Bus into another Node. e.g: `()=>this.refs.myBus`.

[blurmapdyn example ![](/images/2016/12/blurmapdyn.gif)](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/blurmapdyn)
a single ConicalGradient should be used for all blur pass:
![](/images/2016/12/blurmapdynschema.png)

There are a few other good examples of ref usages:

- [blurmapmouse](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/blurmapmouse)
- [blurimgtitle](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/blurimgtitle) (same example that was features in 2016 React conf!)
- [behindasteroids](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/behindasteroids), crazy port of a game I made for js13k.

> The `()=>ref` pattern works only if you call the function after component did update (refs are set at this time).

## The good ol' children function

There is another pattern for more specific needs: instead of composing by giving an element, you can also compose by giving a **Function that returns an element**. Why that? Because, it's a way to nicely give you the redraw function: `redraw => <Video onFrame={redraw} />`:

[Checkout video example ![](/images/2016/12/videoredraw.png)](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/video?menu=true)

> We really just want to redraw if there is a new video frame.

We have merged the 2 patterns into one: if you provide a function, it's just called with `redraw`, and the returned value is used as a texture. We have a few cases to detect what kind of texture it is (and also an [extensible mechanism](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/api#textureloaders) used by implementations to load platform specific objects).
[(checkout this if you want to see the code)](https://github.com/gre/gl-react/blob/a33e6aa685479d588646b20dd62e1e25a64a5a47/packages/gl-react/src/Node.js#L704-L783)

## Node backbuffering & Backbuffer symbol

A new feature allows to inject the previous Node state as a texture. This is called backbuffering. One simple usecase is to implement Motion Blur persistence (like the GIF on top of this article).

We can also accumulate a state, for instance, to implement Game of Life!

[Game of life glider example ![](/images/2016/12/gol.gif)](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/golglider)

And the whole idea of gl-react (and React) is about composition. For instance, doing a rotating effect of that Game of Life is basically just `<Rotate> <GameOfLife /> </Rotate>`.

An interesting part is that you can update the GameOfLife at a rate that is independent from the **Rotate** rendering: just by making GameOfLife a pure component that receives a tick, or implementing shouldComponentUpdate update (you have as many choices as React have to [shortcut the rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent)).

[golrotscu example![](/images/2016/12/golrot.gif)](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/golrotscu)

> See the counters that indicate the number of redraw. (the capture preview in the Box only get snapshot each 100ms, but in the real canvas, it runs at 60 FPS)

Finally, please checkout [ibex example](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/ibex) (extracted from another JS13K game! xD).

> You can't leave this article before seeing [ibex example](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/ibex)! I'm serious, this is probably the most accomplished code I ever wrote! xD

## <a name="under_the_hook_redraw"></a> under the hood of Surface and Node redraw

In order to make redraw efficient, `gl-react` have 2 phases: the `redraw()` phase and the `flush()` phase (reflecting the respective methods available both on `Surface` and `Node`). This is a bit like a rendering engine:

- **`redraw()` phase** sets a dirty flag to a Node and all its "dependents" (other nodes, buses, surface). _redraws happen generally bottom-up to the Surface._
- **`flush()` phase** draws all nodes that have the redraw flag. _draws happens top-down from the Surface._

`redraw()` is directly hooked to React update lifecycle (re-rendering a Node will calls `redraw()` for you).
To make this system efficient, **the flush() is by default asynchronous**, i.e. `redraw()` means scheduling a new gl draw.
Surface have a main loop that runs at 60 fps and call `flush()`. This is very efficient because if Surface does not have the redraw flag, `flush()` does nothing.

> In gl-react inspector, clicking on the redraw count will call `redraw()` on the node / bus. We can illustrate that only "dependents" get redrawn using the advanced [blurimgtitle example](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/blurimgtitle):

[only "dependents" get redrawn ![](/images/2016/12/blurimgtitle-redraw.gif)](https://gl-react-cookbook.surge.sh/blurimgtitle)

This redraw/flush phases allow to prevent and skip rendering multiple times a Node. In some cases, we still want to redraw synchronously: with `<Node/>` `sync` prop. For instance, in Game of Life, we don't want to skip an update (the initial update set the initial GoL state, if it was async it might get skipped).

## Bonus

### Flow types

Flow types has been used for more robust code and better user experience. BTW, [WebGLRenderingContext will soon be released in flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow/pull/2764).

### Atom highlighting

If you are using Atom Editor, you can have JS inlined GLSL syntax highlighted.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/211411/20623048/0527cce2-b306-11e6-85ee-5020be994c10.png)

_To configure this:_

- add `language-babel` package.
- Configure `language-babel` to add `GLSL:source.glsl` in settings "_JavaScript Tagged Template Literal Grammar Extensions_".
- (Bonus) Add this CSS to your _Atom > Stylesheet_:

```css
/* language-babel blocks */
atom-text-editor::shadow .line .ttl-grammar {
  /* NB: designed for dark theme. can be customized */
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
atom-text-editor::shadow .line .ttl-grammar:first-child:last-child {
  display: block; /* force background to take full width only if ttl-grammar is alone in the line. */
}
```

### Tests: almost 100% coverage!

The library is tested directly on the command line, thanks to [Jest][jest] and [headless-gl][headless-gl] _(Big up to [mikolalysenko](https://github.com/mikolalysenko) for [headless-gl][headless-gl]!)_.
**gl-react have 2000 line of tests, involving a lot of gl calls, and readPixels, and it runs... in a few seconds!** _(to Jest devs: you are wizards!)_

One limitation is that all tests need to be in a single file. [I created an issue here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2029). I think it's either an issue in [Jest][jest] or in [headless-gl][headless-gl].

## Tradeoffs and remaining work

The library tradeoffs are written in [TRADEOFFS.md](https://github.com/gre/gl-react/blob/master/TRADEOFFS.md). We might cover some unexplored direction in a near future and solve some of them.

v3 is still in development, the main unfinished part is the React Native implementation which is now the main priority of the library.
It will probably rely on an awesome initiative: a React Native WebGL implementation started in Exponent by [@nikki](https://github.com/nikki93)!

For more information, see [v3 alpha: development in progress](https://github.com/gre/gl-react#v3-alpha-development-in-progress).
