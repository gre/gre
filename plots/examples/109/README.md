This is a continuation of exploration started at [plot#107](/plots/107), but this time alternating between horizontal and vertical lines. As before, it uses a tiny bit of perlin noise to diverge a bit the lines. The randomness distribution has been customized to approach more the edges.

I switched to fountain pen for better precision. Only using one ink... But what an ink! _"Bloody Brexit" by Diamine._
