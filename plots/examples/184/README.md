A total of 11307 hexagons are drawn with a fountain pen to fill 3963 hexagons. The shapes are themselves positioned in hexagons. It takes 2 hours to perform on the speed I chose for a watercolor 300g/m paper. The ink changes color due to the amount of ink flow (it flows less and less). The ink is 'Bloody Brexit' and **there is only this one ink used!**.
