Like for [plots/387](/plots/387), this packs doodle on a A4 watercoor paper and using this time 3 different inks. We can now see better the spiral sampling technique used.

This is a mix of `Make a sea of shapes.` and `3 colors` for [Genuary.art](https://genuary.art) JAN.21 _"Combine two (or more) of your pieces from previous days to make a new piece."_. You can also see I have reused packing techniques like in the first genuary.art pieces I had.
