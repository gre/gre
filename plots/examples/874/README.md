Happy New Year! We start this year with a participation to [Genuary.art](https://genuary.art/) challenge.

Genuary 2023 #1 is "Perfect loop / Infinite loop / endless GIFs".

Like all other [plotloop](/plots/tags/plotloop), I used a grid of frames that I plotted and animated back into a stop-motion video.

This was made with fountain pen inks: Diamine Amber and Diamine Amazing Amethyst. A3 paper grid of 3 by 4 frames.

**each individual card is planned to be included as extra gift to my 12 next physical plot orders this year.**
