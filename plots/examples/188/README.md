@greweb's #10 plot loop. That animation is the main digital art.

A high-quality video is available in 11 NFT editions, one per frame, for buyers to acquire each physical frame.

This work took me a lot of dedication to plot the 11 frames for an (interrupted) one week long! Each frame taking almost 2 hours to plot, you can't really cheat here, I like to think the process to be some sort of *Proof Of Plot*.

It is getting sold by **achetezdelart** on OpenSea. Detail is in the description.

## Making-of and technical notes

It is probably one of the craziest main.rs source code I wrote for a plot, notably because I have combined in one script many different techniques, most of them explored earlier in other dedicated plots.

I tried to put in this plot loop my best artwork and recent iterations of color packing experiments.

The work is technically composed of 3 circles rotating in the middle of a lot of circles packing. Each circle contains itself a specific art technique:

- shape contouring, to remind a bit exploration of [plotloop#136](/plots/136)
- square packing, which is a direct reuse of logic of [plot#180](/plots/180) with however a unique nesting of squares to create more depth.
- layered lines in circles, which is an innovation that I'm going to re-explore (starting with next [plot#189](/plots/189))

## Early prototypes I had!

It was a hard choice to give up on colors and stay on a minimalistic black.

I do not plan to sell these at this stage.
