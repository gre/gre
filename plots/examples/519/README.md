**This plot reveals a new generator called "Field"**. The whole area is used with lines following a strong field formed with repetitives abstract shapes. Some circles are used to color differently the area.

The physical is a grid of 4x2 frames that can be used to produce a 8 frames loop video.

_As always, it's by making a lot of prototypes that we can verify plotting constraints. I take this opportunity to share a series of reveals that will show main features of "Plottable Field (8 frames)" â€“ my next plottable generative art on [fx(hash) platform](https://fxhash.xyz/u/greweb)._
