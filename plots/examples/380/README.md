This implements the prompt **"Color gradients gone wrong." (JAN.16)** for the [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) event.

I used all my fountain pens and inks at my disposal to plot a matrix of them all. It went wrong because there are some glitches and some ink was a bit saturated (too intense, so it appears black).
