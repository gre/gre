> *Prototype of an ongoing collaboration with [Arthur Simony](https://www.instagram.com/arthursimony), plotting words in spirals.*

A side experiment was to use a square to circle transitional spiral. We chose not to keep this one and we later refocused on the circle spiral.

The idea was also to associate different colors to different words, with a strong collision.
