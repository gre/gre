_As always, it's by making a lot of prototypes that we can verify plotting constraints. I take this opportunity to share a series of 7 "reveals" that will show main features of "Plottable Wireframe (8 frames)" – my next plottable generative art on [fx(hash) platform](https://fxhash.xyz/u/greweb)._

**This will be the first generative plot loop on a generative art marketplace!**

The concept is that a physical plot of 8 frames on a A4 paper can be animated back into an animation. The digital preview will be nice as well.

The plot looks like this:

This first plot reveals the concept of looping into 3D noise and also show you "flat" areas in that noise, this is a reboot of [plots/448](/plots/448) with a better loop animation: the trick was to slide on a cylinder in Perlin 3D (see [Twitter thead](https://twitter.com/greweb/status/1524490017531432961)).

To make it convenient, I've developed my own script and my own tooling to easily make these plot loop for the future!
