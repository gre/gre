description: "'Destructive Storm' pushes the paper to its limits and lets things 'glitch' as the theme of this #plotparty day. The plot took more than 12 hours to draw, traveled about one kilometer on an A3 watercolor paper. The quantity of inks consumed represents about 2.5 fully-filled fountain pens. This is a continuation of #312 exploration using circle packing and domain warping techniques to make a force field and throw particles in it."

For this 4th day of [#plotparty](https://penplotterartwork.com/plotparty/), the idea is to make "Postcards".

I've decided to continue digging my #312 exploration, moving now to 3 different inks (Amazing Amethyst, Soft Mint, Bloody Brexit) used at a ratio of 70%, 20%, 10%. Each color get randomly distributed on different spirals, randomness made it that the Amethyst color went on the biggest which is why it's named after that ink.

The plot took about 10 hours to perform on a A3 watercolor paper.

**The art piece has been cut into 8 parts to make 8 individual Postcards that will be distributed to other #plotparty artists. This makes it a fractional art piece!**

Here is a high resolution (12000x8422) photo of the piece before it was fractioned:

Here are the 2 stops I did between the 3 inks:

And here is a video preview of how it looked at the last plotting hour:
