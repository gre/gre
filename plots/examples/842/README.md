Step 1. We asked ChatGPT to generate imaginary creatures.

> `The Flutterbee, a small creature with the body of a bumblebee and the wings of a butterfly. It has a fluffy, striped coat in shades of yellow and black, and its wings are iridescent and shimmer in the light. The Flutterbee has a long, curved proboscis that it uses to sip nectar from flowers`

Step 2. We feed that prompt to Midjourney to give us a random image from this description.

Step 3. We process the image using our own original logic of vectorisation packing a stack of spirals and stopping when white color is needed in the image.
