Plottable Letters plays with letters, digits, and basic shapes. There is a great chance to obtain a "GM", but also many other letter combination.

Many NFTs are available to mint with an interesting variety of results. As in [previous generators](/2021/12/plottable-mountain-moons), owning the NFT confer the power to request a physical plot on: https://greweb.me/plots/nft â€“ this is optional and you can also just enjoy the digital version.
