ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤© **This plot is the physical counterpart that was collected by [@zancan](https://twitter.com/zancan)**. A custom ink was requested (green instead of red, I used Diamine Evergreen).

A quick recap of the whole process:

- Last week was released 'Plottable Circleception' generator on [fxhash.xyz](<https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/plottable-circleception-(8-frames)>)
- It generates digital NFT of an animation. Each outcome is the recipe of the plot that also can be physically produced.
- Each owner of such recipe can request me a plot via https://greweb.me/plots/nft which can then produces a physical output (with fountain pens, ink and paper)
- The physical output is shipped to the collector
- At the same time, I also produce back a digital stop-motion animation. This physical art digitalized back into a loop is itself unique in analog details.
- It is immortalized back into an NFT and gifted to the collector as well. Such "physical plot loop" NFT can have its own life aside of the initial recipe. Interestingly, the recipe is digital-only VS the physical plot loop will have the physical medium speaking.
