Made for Genuary 2023 #22 "Shadows".

Two inks where used: Diamine Turquoise and Sailor Seiboku.

There is an accidental misalignment in the two colors.

I have implemented z-indexing and avoided to draw triangles over existing triangles, however in a bit too pessimistic way which can make triangles fully dropped. It's also not implemented in a performant way at all, but it was fun to figure it out.
