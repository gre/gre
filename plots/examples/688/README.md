**Scurry.** _noun._ a situation of hurried and confused movement.

> A GIF image of a stickman is used. the trick was to rotate the stickman based on a "smoothed average" of the mountain slope, but actually not strictly the slope, doing a weighted mix between a vertical angle and the actual slope, because we tend to "stay vertical" when we climb mountain for instance. I love how some part looks like the main is accelerating and deccelerating that way.
