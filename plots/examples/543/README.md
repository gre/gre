**This plot reveals a new generator called "Circleception"** that I started developing on Twitch and later finalized into a fx(hash) generator.

The physical is a grid of 4x2 frames that can be used to produce a 8 frames loop video.

'Circleception' explores fractal-like zoom loops (the art infinitely reproduces inside itself), packing circles, filled with various techniques.
