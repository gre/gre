Today is 200th day of 2021. I started plotting on January 1 on a daily cycle, so let's celebrate this 200th plot. I'm using here a very similar technique as explored in [plots#198](/plots/198) with even more tight lines and different settings used in combination with a coffee cup photo.

This plot is a tribute to artist _Sean M Puckett_ ([@PhotoPluck](https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck) on Twitter), who I consider an incredible artist of the plotting scene. They are frequently releasing impressive photo-driven plots, pushing the boundaries of what can be done with fountain pens. Please check their work on https://twitter.com/PhotoPuck.

I like their regular "Monday coffee plot" that I wanted to celebrate.
