_Honk honk!_

Many spirals are stacked on top of each other with a variation of rotation and position.

This quick experiment is an entry for the "Spiral" theme of [@sableraph](https://twitter.com/sableRaph)'s weekly generative art challenge. 2 plots were made (634 and 635).

_Don't be afraid to open the source code :)_
