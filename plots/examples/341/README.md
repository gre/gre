This plot is the genesis piece that covers my new Plottable Mesh generator.

Many NFTs are available to mint with an interesting variety of results. As in [previous generators](/2021/12/plottable-mountain-moons), owning the NFT confer the power to request a physical plot on: https://greweb.me/plots/nft â€“ this is optional and you can also just enjoy the digital version.

## Artistic direction and rare aspects

The generator generalizes a bunch of past explorations you can find on https://greweb.me/plots

A noise shape is mirrored to produce symmetry effect and, using marching square, transposed into lines. Lines are "doubled" to offer more depth in the pattern.

The noise can be more or less intense, from a smooth mesh to stronger patterns.

One of the important innovations is the "intersection" mecanism: lines of a shape stop when its "mirrored" version also stop, which makes areas without any lines and intensify the patterns. The intersection logic can diverge to allow a bit "non intersected parts".

One rarity aspect is the color you will get. It will sometimes be a 2-colors plot to emphasize on the mirror duality.

There are many other rarity aspects and the general variety will offer a wide range of results.


## The density technical challenge

As these are plottable, it was complex to adjust the number of lines depending on the intensity of the noise.

I had some early failed prototypes caused by too many lines: the pen was literally digging into the paper! I have adjusted these to hopefully no longer happen.

### Prototype Prototype Prototype

Like said in https://greweb.me/2021/12/plottable-mountain-moons, "Prototype Prototype Prototype" is the way to go for these physical pen/paper issues!

The following photos are prototype plots that shows some different explorations but do not guarantee these will be possible outcomes, but it mostly could!
