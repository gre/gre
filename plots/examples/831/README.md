The goal was to raymarch from inside a volume using a rotating ray that moves on an axis forming a spiral.

2 blob spheres are fusion into each other with some noise perturbation.

As there are no shading at all, we don't really see the 3D, so the plot made here is still extremely basic but the primitives of a raymarcher are here.
