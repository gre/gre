> *Prototype of an ongoing collaboration with [Arthur Simony](https://www.instagram.com/arthursimony), plotting words in spirals.*

We added cases where the words would be separated with a bigger gap which reinforced visiblity of patterns on the spiral. In some cases, you no longer see the words but mainly see the patterns.
