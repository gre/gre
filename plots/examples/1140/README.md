This week, we celebrate #plotparty, which is a internet challenge in pen plotting community consisting of 5 consecutive days of themes.

For June 13, 'No Paper' is the theme. 

In context of a Paris' exhibition with [Matthieu Poli](https://www.instagram.com/matthieu_poli/) and [Sven Bj√∂rn Fi](https://www.instagram.com/svenbjorn.fi/), we spontaneously decided to make a plot directly in the sand of the Gallerie Beausoleil.
