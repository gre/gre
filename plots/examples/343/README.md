*This plot is the second of a series of 7 plots that reveal "Plottable Circles" – my next plottable generative art on [fx(hash) platform](https://fxhash.xyz/u/greweb).*

This second fountain pen plot shows that getting only one shape is a possibility, and diverges away from being a circle! It also highlights the new compression mechanism implemented to allow a wide range of amplitude on the lines without hurting the paper. My previous exploration was creating a problem as it was crossing the lines, I've made it bounces to avoid this issue.
