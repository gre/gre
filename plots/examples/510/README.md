**This second plot reveals the concept of "holes" in the wireframe** that can sometimes occur. We can also see a different frequency of looping into the "cylinder" as we can see more than 1 wave at a given time (unlike [plots/509](/plots/509)).

_As always, it's by making a lot of prototypes that we can verify plotting constraints. I take this opportunity to share a series of 7 "reveals" that will show main features of "Plottable Wireframe (8 frames)" – my next plottable generative art on [fx(hash) platform](https://fxhash.xyz/u/greweb)._
