This funny plot was made for @sableraph weekly contest.

This is a Plot Loop: an animation made of 24 individual plots, as there are 24 frames in the original GIF.

This was plotted as a grid on A3 watercolor paper. @sableraph if you see this, I am happy to send you out this plot.

I like the fact that the plotted grid is also very well aligned: you can see that the head rotate by 90Â° horizontally, a column itself is loopable. You can rotate that grid in all possible orientation and still get the same plot loop!

I used my own tool to accurated crop the frames:
