Plotted live during NFC Lisbon conference on 10 cm square watercolor paper with fountain pen. Fire and ice ink.

This uses a "low poly custom perlin noise" to implement mountains and sky. It is a continuation of [Horizon of hope](/plots/424) in a more minimalistic way of the small size of the plot.
