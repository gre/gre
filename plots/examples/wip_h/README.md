This artwork is created with code, using the distance function to the "H" letter with a 5 lines pattern along the distance field. The generator was able to yield a lot of variations and I had to chose one.

Chosing one outcome among all possibilities that a generator can yield may be one of the hardest choice a generative artist have to do. There were tons of possibilities that my generator was offering but I chose to stay in minimalism.

I chose to stay on the minimalism seed=42 of this generator. 42 is everything.

From that digital piece is produced a physical work on black paper.

This piece is very symbolic of plotting and shows how complex the reliability of ink flow of gel pens can be, even for the most minimalistic piece. I had to recover 2 parts in the middle of the plots as it can be seen on this timelapse:

This plot is a premium plot that will be sold in a future auction.
