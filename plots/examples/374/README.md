**Tribute to [@maxwellinked's work](https://objkt.com/profile/maxwellinked)** and notably the "Waiting Room": https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/606990.

This is a different version of [/plots/369](/plots/369) playing with different values. This plot was offered to maxwellinked <3

Please check @maxwellinked's work, Tim Maxwell is an awesome artist that is drawing by hand with a pen a lot of consecutive lines. I have tried to reproduce some of his style with automation and with a plotting machine in context of [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) prompt **_"Trade styles with a friend."_** (JAN.6)

A4 watercolor paper, fountain pen with Black ink.
