This plot is a physical interpretation of a digital artwork created by the artist [minimizer](https://twitter.com/minimizer_art) from his project "Scribbled Daydreams". I minted #122 and wanted to share one way to plot it. I have plotted on A4 paper using fountain pens and Diamine inks: Turquoise, Hope Pink, Amber, Soft Mint, Onyx Black.
