Plotter's journey is made of simple plots like these. The robot had one job: plot a lot of plus. The result has been pretty unexpected.

First of all, I had issue on offset of my second color which make the plus literally colliding, secondly the center area had the paper waving and raising a bit which made brush paint more color. Finally, the way the plus are no longer plus is interesting, it almost looks like some sort of plants or snail shapes, depending on your imagination!

Before that plot, I had a first try with bigger and more distanced plus, but it was too simple to me:
