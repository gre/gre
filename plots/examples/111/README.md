Parametric functions are classical entities that i've explored many times (from first day!)...

- ...in classical forms: [plot#001](/plots/001), [plot#003](/plots/003), [plot#007](/plots/007), [plot#013](/plots/013), [plot#038](/plots/038), [plot#096](/plots/096), [plot#096](/plots/096),...
- ... in more funky forms: [plot#071](/plots/071), [plot#073](/plots/073), [plot#080](/plots/080), [plot#082](/plots/082), [plot#084](/plots/084), [plot#087](/plots/087), [plot#095](/plots/095), [plot#090](/plots/090), [plot#097](/plots/097),...

This is however the first time I think about stacking parametic functions: It might not be very perceptible but it is basically 150 parametric functions projected on different scales. The idea comes a bit from the "Planet holes" idea ([plot#100](/plots/100)), circles with different radius.

I might not have taken the best parametric for this plot but it's still fun. Indeed, the pen digged a bit too much in the paper and I might try again with other parametric functions in future.

The ink used is "Bloody Brexit" by Diamine, like on [plot#109](/plots/109), which produces interesting reflection in combination with a good paper (A4 Canson 250g/mm Bristol) and lamp.
