Parametric functions are classical entities that i've explored many times (from first day!).

I explored it in classical ways: [plot#001](/plots/001), [plot#003](/plots/003), [plot#007](/plots/007),[plot#013](/plots/013),[plot#038](/plots/038), [plot#096](/plots/096), [plot#096](/plots/096)

but also in very funky ways: [plot#071](/plots/071), [plot#073](/plots/073), [plot#080](/plots/080), [plot#082](/plots/082), [plot#084](/plots/084), [plot#087](/plots/087), [plot#095](/plots/095), [plot#090](/plots/090), [plot#097](/plots/097)

This time however, it's the first time I think about doing multiple parametric one on top of the other. It might not be very perceptible but it is basically 150 parametric functions projected on different scales. The idea comes a bit from the "Planet holes" idea ([plot#100](/plots/100)) that you have a circle with different radius but applied to parametric function.

I might not have taken the best parametric for the exercice but it's still fun. Unfortunately, the pen digged a bit too much in the paper and I might try again with other parametric functions in future.

The ink used is "Bloody Brexit" by Diamine, like on [plot#109](/plots/109), which produces interesting reflection in combination with a good paper and lamp.
