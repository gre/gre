This week, we celebrate #plotparty, which is a internet challenge in pen plotting community consisting of 5 consecutive days of themes.

For June 12, 'Portrait' is the theme. I decided to reboot some code from [plots#906](/plots/906) and combine it again with my AI portrait used in [plots#839](/plots/839).

The image was generated by AI using mid journey and trying to describe myself (an artist with a hat and glasses) as I wanted to indirectly try to represent myself, making the result unpredictible and blurry in the first place.

Then, that image is used as a lookup, vectorized with generative code placing random squares. each square is made with zig zag lines that can be physically plotted.

As i myself struggle with aphantasia, i wanted to represent how it's like not to visualize (even tho my mind's eye is actually full black)
