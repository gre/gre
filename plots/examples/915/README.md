This was streamed live on koop.xyz on February 17th, 2023. This plot is one of the 8 results we did that day.

Livedraw allows a real time interactivity with the pen plotter where viewers can decide art directions in real time.

From all over the world & beyond physical boundaries, we can still co-create physical art.
