Here is "Ring of faces" my 8th ["plot loop" (see article)](https://greweb.me/2021/05/plot-loops). The main digital art is a 1920p video loop of 8 frames available as a [Tezos hicetnunc NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/144002). The physical art is 8 frames of A4 size, plotted with a black fountain pen on 300 g/m2 grain paper, and offered when [buying the NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/144002) (8 editions, assigned in buy order).

The name 'Ring of faces' refers to generating different silhouettes of faces from pure noise. The work involved here is purely generative art (nothing draw manually). I had a selection phase where I chose this one among 100 results.

I like these eight plots series because there are many unique faces here. You can even imagine faces in the inner area. That is purely a reflection of your own imagination.

I also played a lot with this duality to put twice the art in inversed coloring filling mode as well as having a rotation. The animation between the two tiles is offset exactly by 50% while also allowing a good variety and similarity when you buy one specific frame.

I used a high grain paper this time which works well with the cross-hatching filling method used, also thanks to a not too crowded area. I usually would avoid such paper for fountain pens that can "bleed" too much on it. It's time to do it more in the future!

The general animation is inspired by a shader I wrote https://greweb.me/shaderday/68

The effect called 'Apophenia' is, in this case, our ability to recognize a face silhouette in pure noise.

I see these different silhouettes:

- an indigenous face
- Churchill
- a bearded man
- a woman

Go figure why.
