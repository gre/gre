Remake of my Inktober entry shared at [/plots/688](/plots/688).

I found a bit too late that I missed to interpolate the stickmen positions, which is why I made a second version: [plots/730](/plots/730).

Black ink drawn with fountain pen on A3 watercolor paper. The work is made with 10 individual frames, then animated with stop-motion technique.
