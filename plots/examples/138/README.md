transition of two parametric spirals. I called it 'parametric oddity' because one of the parametric frequency is literally an 'odd number' which makes it having this mesh effect. Fountain pen with 'Red Dragon' on white bristol A4.

basically it's a transition between `(10πt,41πt)` and `(8πt,8πt)` with radius that varies all along to make it a spiral. 41 is the oddity here!

The parametric is repeated twice with a slightly different perlin noise displacement to add some moiré effect on top of this.
