title: "Charcoal friction (experiment)"
description: "some plastic debris (from 3D prints) are put under the paper to alter the charcoal line texture. weight is added on the charcoal, which inevitably made it break at some point in that plot. I wanted to play with friction and fragility of charcoal in this experiment"

This experiment played with a charcoal drawing on a 60x40cm paper with a lot of dust of plastic debris under the paper to try to create located texture. It is extremely unpredictible and I had a bunch of fun failures in the process making.

When it did not completely failed, the resulting texture has been quite interesting:

I had two crazy failures:
