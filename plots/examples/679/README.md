This experiment played with a charcoal drawing on a 60x40cm paper with a lot of dust of plastic debris under the paper to try to create located texture. It is extremely unpredictible and I had a bunch of fun failures in the process making.

When it did not completely failed, the resulting texture has been quite interesting:

Timelapse:

How it works:

I had two crazy failures:
