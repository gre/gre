> This artwork is born from a collaboration with [@LeLapinMignon](https://twitter.com/Lelapinmignon). The generative piece is plotted with a fountain pen robot drawing a 73 meter-long curve on a watercolor gradient and then digitally enhanced. Curious exploration of different mediums, from physical to digital.

Beginning April 2022, I was at [NFC Lisbon conference](https://twitter.com/greweb/status/1512811231677145091) and met with [@LeLapinMignon](https://twitter.com/Lelapinmignon), a French artist who is making "Augmented Watercolour" art work. She gaves me a watercolor gradient base that I could use and experiment using pen plotting techniques.

On Tuesday, April 26th, 2022, a live stream on Twitch happened, where I coded a generative program, curated one result out of many possibilites, and then used the AxiDraw plotter to plot it with a fountain pen filled with [Diamine Aurora Borealis](https://mountainofink.com/blog/diamine-aurora-borealis) ink.

This was a cool experience, interactive with the chat too, and the plotter slowly revealed the creation, **tracing one 73-meters-long curve for an hour!**

Later on, [@LeLapinMignon](https://twitter.com/Lelapinmignon) finalized the work with her Augmented Watercolor magic and produced this mesmerizing result. This was such a cool experiment, I am thrilled by this collaboration and the possibilites of mixing digital and physical art.
