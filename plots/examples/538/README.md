Pixel Art plotting fan art made for [Tinyfolks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1909420/Ti), a game developed by [@pyairvander](https://www.twitch.tv/pyairvander), released today Jun 1th, 2022.

[@pyairvander](https://www.twitch.tv/pyairvander) is streaming all is game development on Twitch and I was given a gif of one of the character of the game on which I played trying to plot it with fountain pen.

The code is pretty straightforward. There are 2 techniques at stake here: [Marching squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) which do the contouring around the pixels and then a simple spiral that lift the pen up when we don't want to put ink.

It was done on https://twitch.tv/greweb
