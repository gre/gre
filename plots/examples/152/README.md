This is a fresh experimentation of noise domain warping with glitches. As many of my previous plots, this is a 2-pass spiral parametric function, displaced with perlin noise warpped into each other (see "domain warping"). The spiral ends up being unstable and "breaks apart" with intentional glitches: the line is stopped as soon as two datapoints are to far from each other, as a spiral get bigger and bigger it inevitably ending up breaking apart completely in various places which combined with the parametric function makes some sort of humano√Ød shape!

I sent some video while it was getting plotted. It started from the middle and the beginning is quite interesting and could itself be made a standalone. All of these are very exploratory and may be revisited later!
