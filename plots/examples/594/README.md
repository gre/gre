This is a continuation of the generator made at [plots/502](/plots/502) with some tweaks and using inks Diamine Hope Pink and Indigo. This was made with fountain pens and it took more than 10 hours to execute it with a AxiDraw plotter on A3 paper.

The A3 plot that form a map was then fragmented into 8 parts (post card format). **This is art fragmentation**.

> 🎁 The 8 parts was shipped together to _someone_ who do not know it yet! They will actually chose what to do with them! Will they be reunited again?🙂

On the back of each A6 fragment is written a reference to this page as well as the number of the fragment.

cutting A3 in 8 pieces offers enough details. I hope people enjoy it. "art fragmentation" is something I want to experiment more & more. The idea is so powerful: every part is 1:1 unique, yet all connected together and could be reunited to form the original.
