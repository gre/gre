Continuation of [plot#113](/plots/113) with different parametric functions.

- Sakura Gelly Roll white on black. (clairefontaine 210g)
- STA pigment liner 0.05mm on white. (canson bristol A4)

The black plot have an interesting precision which makes it smooth from a far look but the details of this plot are interesting as well. I'm not yet sure what creates the vertical line glitch we see on both plots, is it the paper? is it my robot? It is part of the art now.
