Another exploration of [plots#112](/plots/112), more delicate than [plots#115](/plots/115), with a centered noise of fibers. It uses two fountain pen inks for different color tones (Aurora Borealis and Writer's Blood from Diamine). I could try with even more lines in future but these are already almost 2 hours of plotting time! A4 on Bristol.
