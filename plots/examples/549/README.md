Lines are getting plotted with fountain pen on watercolor paper. The yellow is overlapping on top of the red color, I wanted to see if the ink would actually "bleed" and fade from the red to yellow but it didn't happen, however we have interesting effect at the "end" of the lines (plotting from left to right) because the ink accumulates more on ends. I wanted to see how the medium expresses in a very minimalistic plot. Lines are drawn each 0.3 millimeters and the fountain pen stroke width is approximatively of 0.35 millimeters.
