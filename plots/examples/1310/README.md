for [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art) 05, I have revisited a creation from Vera Molnár, pioneer of computer art. We randomly spawn polygons forming rows respectively to Vera's creation and fill them with my "Worms filling" algorithm to make it plottable. The result is plotted with a fountain pen on watercolor paper. This was streamed on my Twitch channel.
