**This plot shows the physical counterpart of the cover a new generator called "Circleception"**.

The physical is a grid of 4x2 frames that can be used to produce a 8 frames loop video.

'Circleception' explores fractal-like zoom loops (the art infinitely reproduces inside itself), packing circles, filled with various techniques.
