This plot was requested by the owner of a non-fungible token (NFT) on https://greweb.me/plots/nft. This plot has a interesting backstory: I had to redo it three times because of unpredictable failures that occurred during the plotting process. This is what makes each plot unique, as each run can produce different results, some of which I did not consider good enough.

The image above shows the results of these two failed plots. I gave them to my children, who created their own versions of art piece #107. The image below shows their creations.
