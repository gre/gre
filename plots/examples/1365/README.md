for [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art) "Use a library that you havenâ€™t used before", I have interpreted the theme on my "pen plotter" prism as "Use a technique you never used before" and here goes Dry Pastel! I have never experimented this on a pen plotter and it was a lot of fun. It was done live on a Twitch stream.
