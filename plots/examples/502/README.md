This is a continuation of ideas explored at [plots/464](/plots/464) but with a complete rework of the way the "grid" if affecting the storm, making "squares" shapes more present on top of the organic feel of "Storm". The plot were made in about 7 hours and using Diamine inks "Pink" and "Amber" on **A3** watercolor paper.
