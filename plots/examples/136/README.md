Here is "White Protozoa" my third ["plot loop" (see article)](https://greweb.me/2021/05/plot-loops). The main digital art is a 1920p video loop of 8 frames available as a [Tezos hicetnunc NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/82974). The physical art is 8 frames of A4 size, plotted with white Sakura gen pen on black card paper (210g), and offered when [buying the NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/71006) (8 editions, assigned in buy order).
