Here is "White Protozoa" my third ["plot loop" (see article)](https://greweb.me/2021/05/plot-loops). The main digital art is a 1920p video loop of 8 frames available as a [Tezos hicetnunc NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/82974). The physical art is 8 frames of A4 size, plotted with white Sakura gen pen on black card paper (210g), and offered when [buying the NFT](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/71006) (8 editions, assigned in buy order).

like in [plot#135](/plots/135), this is an exploration of domain warping and marching squares algorithms.

The ending of #1 being plotted, speed x5:

If you like bonus, I had considered many different animations, and they are viewable as GIF (digital black on white) on https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/plots/examples/136

You can also find the full source code, open sourced as 99% of my work. I essentially have a generator of plot loops and I ran it to generate 500 gif and chose among them! It was very hard to decide!

Enjoy!
