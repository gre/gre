This week, we celebrate #plotparty, which is a internet challenge in pen plotting community consisting of 5 consecutive days of themes.

For June 14, 'Symmetry' is the theme. 

I have experimented with stacking two layers of packing minimalistic clouds (from the code of my ongoing project 'Medieval Era'). The shapes are repeated in a reversed way to create a symmetry, yet to allow a dysymmetry due to the z-ordering.
