Plottable Circles explores concentric circles – varies in the different number of circles, noise scales, inks, line widths and includes some rare shapes.

> The digital NFT is the recipe to a plottable art: Owning this NFT confers the right to request a physical plot (A4 square, 21cm by 21cm) – this is an optional possibility as you can already enjoy the digital version.
>
> Digital and Physical art, hybrid and decoupled:
>
> - art published via a digital NFT on Tezos – its digital representation simulates fountain pen inks drawing on paper with animated effects.
> - Token to the physical world: owning each NFT confer the power to request the related physical plot at https://greweb.me/plots/nft
