**This plot reveals a new generator called "Thousands"**. This prototype was made to stress test the paper and guarantee extreme outputs can be plotted correctly.

_As always, it's by making a lot of prototypes that we can verify plotting constraints. I take this opportunity to share a series of reveals that will show main features of "Plottable Thousands" â€“ my next plottable generative art on [fx(hash) platform](https://fxhash.xyz/u/greweb)._
