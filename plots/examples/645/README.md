This is my first plot using my new AxiDraw A1 plotter.

A 70x50cm charcoal plot under the sunlight and vine shadows. Is it a generative digital art, a physical art of a photography art? Maybe a bit of everything.

This is based on generator ["Plottable Slimes"](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/18109) and adapted to A1 size for charcoal usage.
