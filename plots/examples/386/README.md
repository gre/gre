Packing doodle curves explore the idea to combine a few classical generative art technique to draw curious curves.

Factually here are the techniques used:

- Circle packing to distribute the doodles.
- Travelling Salesman Problem to solve connecting closest circles together.
- kmeans clustering to distribute the circles into groups and optimise the TSP.
- "spiral sampling" which is a technique I created and used in many of my past plots. This is what makes the dot part. We don't see it much on this specific plot as the circles are small but I may do more plots in future.

This was implemented as candidate to [genuary.art](https://genuary.art) "Make a sea of shapes." of JAN.20.
