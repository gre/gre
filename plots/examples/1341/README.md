This is a prototype from **Analog Patterns** generator.

*Analog Patterns* is the result of a creative collaboration between the photographers @project_pajon and the generative artist @greweb, known for his plottable creations. The collection focuses on the subtle patterns hidden in the complex natural and human-made environments that we find ourselves in.

The individual unique images are generated with procedural code when minted. 
Each piece of this art collection is created the moment you mint it!
To achieve this the generator uses 100 analog photos from Pajon. For each minted image the generator picks 1 or 2 random photos and composes them using randomly selected collage effects. The rendering is then projected into an only-strokes-version that can be physically plotted with fountain pens (21cm square) and using a random palette of ink.

This hybrid approach, blending photography with procedural code, results in intricate generative outcomes oscillating between realism and abstraction. This highlights the interplay between human and natural patterns and the element of randomness inherent in the artistic process.
