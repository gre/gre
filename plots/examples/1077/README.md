For "Lunar" theme of @sableraph's #wccchallenge of this week, I decided to revisit some minimalistic ideas: the recursive circles packing that I explored 2 years ago in [plots/203](/plots/203).

Except this time, we would fill circle with spirals instead of drawing just the outline. I initially thought about only rendering spirals for the leaf cases of the recursion but after accidentally enabling the effect for all, I found it even more interesting to go into this moir√© effect and the spiral density accumulation. The recursion have 10% chance to stop at each level, as well as a spiral have 10% change to only render a simple circle, to let the background shine through.

**The beauty of plotting is that, even though the idea and the digital version is relatively simple, the physical execution have a lot of random factors that can make each plot really unique.** In the present case, I had random line failures as well as pen not lifting up properly in other cases.
