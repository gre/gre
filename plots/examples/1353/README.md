for [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art) 09 "ASCII", I'm sharing a self-plottable code: A code that self reproduce the SVG of itself and is pen plottable. No font used, just few strokes encoded with a 0..9 grid. From the glyph editor to the pen plot, the dev was entirely streamed on twitch. Replay is available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1z_4jzMDYk.
