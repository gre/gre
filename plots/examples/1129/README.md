> *Prototype of an ongoing collaboration with [Arthur Simony](https://www.instagram.com/arthursimony), plotting words in spirals.*

The words starts to collide like in Arthur Simony's work. A glitched happened when I restarted the plot after an issue which later gave the idea to do some "bold" effect.
