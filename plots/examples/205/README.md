The best part of generative art is accumulating techniques and improving your creative coding skills. You explore your imagination and can combine different ideas and techniques over time once you have "absorbed" them in our playbook. IF you know N techniques, one more technique is now giving you `N*(N+1)` possibilities of outcomes. They can all be crossed over and combined together to produce results. It's exponential.

**Here is the combination of shape packing, applied to triangle polygon, filled with one of my oldest "fill" algorithm that works by rotating around randomly sampled points.**
