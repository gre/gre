Like last year ([L'homme et la machine](/plots/848)), I decided to create something special for Christmas. This time, 172 postcards are offered to my colleagues at Ledger.

This is an artistic interpretation of videos from Ledger commercial of the Ledger Nano X. The work is made physical by the mean of pen plotting with white gel on black paper. The video is made by assembling the 172 frames of the plot by the animating technique of stop motion.

The medium used is fascinating as it's an organic and analog process. Everything is made with strokes and I took artistic directions to map the video pixels into lines using my algorithm called "Worms filling" as it works a bit like if worms were eating food through where there need to be color. You can also see it produces an electric arc effect which is also why the project is called Electric wallets.

At the bottom, there is a small binary pager which indicates the unique number of the frame.

To give an idea of the intense involvement of this artwork, here is an approximative time and cost of this project. Of course, I'm leveraging on many of my past experience, experiments and on my pen plotters machine (which itself have important fixed costs).

- Development: roughly 5 hours. (leveraging on lot of past experiments)
- Pen plotting time: roughly 36 hours (in total). There are 18 sheets to produce and each takes approximatively 2 hours to plot. A sheet is a A3 grid of 8 postcards.
- Pen costs: about 10 Sakura gel pens were used. (approx 3€ each)
- Paper costs: 18 Fabriano A3 black paper were used. (approx 1.10€ each)
- Digitalisation time: roughly 8 hours. I had to photograph each sheet, manually crop and align the 172 images to make back the video. Then I had to cut them all physically. This is taking a lot of time.

That means in total:
- 49 hours of work
- 50€ of material costs

The project was creating in November 2023.
