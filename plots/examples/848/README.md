Each individual plotted postcard were gifted to my colleagues at Ledger. I also plan to mint the resulting digital video on Objkt a bit later this week.

### Video presentation

### Artistic direction

In the artwork "Man and Machine," human figures are shown running up a mountain, accompanied by towering robots. This scene represents the relentless pursuit of progress and innovation, with humans constantly striving to push the boundaries of technology. The robots symbolize the power and potential of AI and robotics, both as a threat and as an opportunity. The mountain represents the challenges and obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve this progress, and the fact that the humans are running alongside the robots shows the intertwined nature of the relationship between humans and technology.

L'oeuvre "l'homme et la machine" explore la tension entre l'homme et la technologie, en particulier l'√©mergence des IA et des robots dans notre vie quotidienne.

L'oeuvre met en lumi√®re les opportunit√©s que cette technologie peut apporter, ainsi que les menaces qu'elle peut repr√©senter pour notre avenir.

L'oeuvre sugg√®re que l'homme est constamment en qu√™te de progr√®s, qu'il s'agisse de bienfaits pour lui-m√™me ou de dangers pour l'humanit√©.

L'oeuvre peut √™tre vue comme une m√©taphore de la course effr√©n√©e de l'homme vers l'avant, sans vraiment r√©fl√©chir aux cons√©quences de ses actions.

L'oeuvre peut √©galement √™tre interpr√©t√©e comme une critique de la d√©pendance croissante de l'homme √† la technologie, et de la perte progressive de son humanit√© √† mesure que les machines prennent de plus en plus de place dans nos vies.

### This is a "plot loop"

This stop-motion animation is a ["plot loop"](/plots/tags/plotloop) made with 80 photos of postcard plots (A6).

This was made with an AxiDraw plotter by batch of 4x2 grid of 10 A3 plots, then cut into 80 postcards. It took about 30 working hours to plot this (on just the plotting phase).

*This kind of exercise makes you understand how big the number "80" is. I can't imagine the gigantic work that Disney Studios had to do when drawing all their frames one by one. I feel lucky to live in 2022 with a plotter ü§ó*

### This is actually generative, entirely made with code

This animation looks to be made manually, but it's entirely generative: it is made from scratch with Rust code and the present output was curated among thousands of variants.

I estimate to have been working more than 50 hours on this project. This work was based on some of my previous work, notably: [plots/832](/plots/832), [plots/767](/plots/767), [plots/509](/plots/509).
