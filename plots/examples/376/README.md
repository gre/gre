This implements the prompt **"Sand" (JAN.15)** for the [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) event.

Plotting a lot of strokes to make the texture of sand and using ONLY perlin noise. Actually glitching perlin noise with a bit of domain warping too.

The generativity of the generator is passionating and was the result of a https://twitch.tv/greweb session, this pick looks like an elephant.

A4 watercolor paper, fountain pen with Diamine Amber ink. A night of plotting time.
