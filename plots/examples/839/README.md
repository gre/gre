A photograph of an artist emerges from the dark spirals. But wait, who is this artist? In fact, they do not exist! The photograph was created using stable diffusion (midjourney). This generator experiments with layering, packing, and stopping spirals depending on the color of an image.

Plotted with Diamine Bloody Brexit on A4 watercolor paper.
