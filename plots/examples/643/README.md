This experiment is based on `Wassily Kandinsky, Circles in a Circle, 1923`. "Kandinsky" was a weekly theme by @sableraph weekly challenge contest.

I tried to implement rules inferred from Kandinsky work, implemented in Rust language, plottable with 5 inks: Amber, Soft Mint, Poppy Red, Skull & Roses and Black.

As this is entirely made in generative art paradigm, I do not directly control the result but curated one among many outcomes. Here is a preview of other outcomes that could also have been plotted:

The generator was live coded on Twitch and a first prototype was plotted (with some failure on the first try ðŸ˜‚)

I then adjusted the line distance and changed pink into a dark blue:
