description: "Using one A3 plot, we make a stop motion strips of 8 frames, and animate back into a video. This is the 'plot loop' technique. This is a continuation of the heads of plots/478 with a better implementation of a noise loop: rotating various layers of perlin noises. This piece was made for #OBJKT4OBJKT celebration."

Using one A3 plot, we make a stop motion strips of 8 frames, and animate back into a video. This is the ["plot loop"](/2021/05/plot-loops) technique. This is a continuation of the heads of [plots/478](/plots/478) with a better implementation of a noise loop: rotating various layers of perlin noises. This piece was made for #OBJKT4OBJKT celebration.
