Following my recent exploration of "weight map" based polylines placing (in Plottable Mandelglitch), I wanted to try to apply the same technique to a photo.

I used a photo of my kids, and plotted with white gel pen and black isograph on a grey paper.

The result is a bit different from my expectation as there were a bit too much white visible here, this is due to plotting the white over the black color.
