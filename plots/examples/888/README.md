A low polygon island is floating in the sky, with triangles as alien objects hovering above it. It was made with Blender, printed with a 3D Printer and painted with acrylic paint to bring the creation to life.


'Shape' is a challenge created by @encremecanique French streamer and it's about making a creation based on a shape contour. This was the shape:

I'm always very excited to have the opportunity to participate in creative challenges. I hope that my contribution to the contest will inspire others to push the boundaries of what is possible with technology and art.

I am constantly striving to improve my skills and push the limits of my imagination, and I am excited to see what the future holds for my artistic endeavors. I would like to thank @encremecanique for organizing this contest, and I look forward to participating in future challenges.
