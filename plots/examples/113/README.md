Another parametric functions. Inspired from [plot#111](/plots/111) idea: stacking multiple parametric functions. The formula is `(0.3+0.7p)f(2πt)+0.05f(8πt)` where p is the growing factor, t is the parametric value and f is a cos for x and sin for y. Sakura Gelly Roll on black A4, revealing artifacts of the paper.
