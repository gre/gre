Plottable Ricochets explores polygon shapes scaled and rotated inside a parametric curve. The curve you obtain can widely vary.

The generator is inspired from something I did back in April: [/plots/99](/plots/99). On this technique to travel on parametric curve points. Instead of using noise, it's just made of very simple polygons. It's actually interesting that complex shapes can be recreated from simple polygons.

The generator is very challenging for the paper to accept the ink pressure and I've implemented some countermeasure for it.
