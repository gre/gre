This plot was made for fun as a contest I did for colleagues, where I asked how much meters of fountain pen ink was used in this. The answer was 93.38 meters.

That plot is gifted to a colleague who estimated at 100 meters.

```

Length of path to draw: 93.38 m.
Pen-up travel distance: 289.31 m.

```
