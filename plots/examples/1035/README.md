This plot is a prototype made before the release of [Plottable Mandelglitch](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/26077).

Plottable Mandelglitch is based on [a shader I created in 2020](https://greweb.me/shaderday/26), but entirely reimplemented in the paradigm of plots. It combines various mandelbrot fractal distortions, noise and domain warping. 21 different inks palette and 5 different paper are possible.
