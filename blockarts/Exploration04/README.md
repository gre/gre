Pattern 03 is a tribute to fountain pen plotting. Using only line strokes, this generator composes many techniques into a unique script, lines follows various noise fields that generate many unique patterns. The BlockArt will be the main creation, the future intent however is that there will be a life on the second market, the possibilities are immense: the NFT allows to download a SVG â€“ the recipe for a physical artist to perform the art with their own ways (@greweb or literally anyone in plotter community). For instance, it could technically be used as an exchange for the physical plot which gives that NFT its true value.

As all BlockStyles, this script visualize Ethereum's block data: The number of transactions of the block drives the general density, The shapes are driven by the block ERC20 transfers USD value vs ETH value transferred: spiral for ETH only, vertical lines for more $ in ETH transfered, horizontal otherwise, cross hatch when there are exceptional ERC20 transfers. (evaluated with Aug 2021 static prices)

There are many rare features to discover and intentionally not all documented: ultimately, don't hunt for the rarity that are "designed by the author", search for the organic rarity and enjoy patterns and unexpected shapes.

Notes:
- mod5 controls the resolution. Using a high value slow down other mods.
- This BlockStyle is a melting pot of technologies: Rust, WASM, SVG and WebGL!

WIP:
- the NFT traits are not finished.
- the SVG need a small optimisation to "dedup the moves".
