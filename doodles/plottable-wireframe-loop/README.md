# Plottable Wireframe (8 frames)

**Collection on https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13157**

More info: https://greweb.me/plots/509

'Wireframe' explores the realm of 3D noise mixed with various generative techniques. Many rare features and easter eggs are to discover.

A SVG file can be exported (right click save) to plot the 8 frames of this animation on a A4 paper. This collection is the first "plot loop" generator on a NFT marketplace.

You can enjoy the digital version that simulate ink effects and optional, thanks to the utility token decoupling, get a physical one: the digital NFT is the recipe to a plottable art piece, owning it confers the right to plot or request a physical plot from @greweb (https://greweb.me/plots/nft). @greweb would use fountain pens but other plotting artists are free to achieve it with their own materials and ship to collectors â€“ as long as NFT is owned at request time.
