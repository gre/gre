## Release

This generator will be released on Saturday 21th May 2022 as a [FX(hash) generator](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/greweb) on which people can collect variants of output of the generator as an NFT. That can later be used to request me a physical plot on https://greweb.me/plots/nft.

This will be the first generative plot loop on a generative art marketplace! The concept is that a physical plot of 8 frames on a A4 paper can be animated back into an animation. The digital preview have an interesting ink and paper simulation as in my previous work.

_Source code will be released soon after the release._
