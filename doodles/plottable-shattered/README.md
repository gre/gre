> Shattered [adj] – broken into many small pieces.
>
> This plottable NFT generator visualizes the explosion of polygons (e.g. squares) into pieces – each rendered using different filling techniques and suggested inks. There are different cases to discover: shapes, filling methods, alignments, distributions.
> 
> The plots can be plotted with fountain pens on A4 paper, but the plotter artist is free to interpret them differently. (on pens, inks, papers – the possibilities are endless!) Depending on your configuration, the plot can take between 15 minutes to a few hours to execute.

> @greweb can ship plotted editions to NFT owners with a small extra cost via https://greweb.me/plots/nft
