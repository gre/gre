PRIO:
- scene splits
  - no mountain case => castle on water. pilloris.
- battlefield placement. def/neutral/attack areas
- castle destruction. fire/smoke that goes with it
- battlefield extra details. people with machines & all other new objs
- castle extra details (illumination, flags,..) 
- boat variety.
- destruction map to impact battlefield too. we should also have a noise map for where the targets are

SCENE SPLITS:
- rethink a bit the splits (front/sea/mountains/sky)
  - and allow some rare cases
    - no sea?
    - only sea? boat battle? we need better boat like the defender have the relic on one?
  - reflection could be a bit more compressed when it's smaller area

CASTLE:
- rework castle
  - defenders on the walls
  - watch towers
  - stairs
  - lights
- bush at bottom of walls to balance a bit the mountain is sometimes very curvy.

BATTLEFIELD:
- Shield have bad clipping?
- organize ArmyOnMountain fight. divide the terrain. rework the code to add more kind of items and people.
  - rework army on mountain spawn: we need to look between the 2 ridges
  - we would use an area map.
  - make them aligned into areas. for instance i want to see alignment of archers and alignement of shields.
  - make a neutral area. which could allow to spawn forest and wild animals.
  - in the army, we need a leader. they will either have a flag OR a weapon that is bigger and colored with the team color.
  - hut positionning too
  - animals in neutral
  - we have to chose a count of units to spawn "globally". and we will have only one look to try to spawn where they can be.
  - orient the body depending on terrain angle
  - align the units using some kind of distance line. (maybe it works well with range on the oriented noise)
- yordering:
  - human to emit two renderables..
- machines / caravans:
  - add folks on the machines.
  - do something with Cage. army transporting someone.
  - have a horse caravan version. where we can put relique / cage..
  - attacker supposed to climp on the belfry
  - Belfry improvements.
  - ADD: Catapult
  - ADD: dragon canon. throw fireball with lot of particle in direction to the castle.
    - one guy with a torch to fire the canon.
- MONKS:
  - SPECIAL merlin? golden, big, stick
  - merge Monk into Human. we need a concept of HoldingObject::Foreign
  - more monks around the relics. it should form a travel line.
- blazon & their impact + flags
  - on shield SHAPE.
  - on boat/belier head
- ADD: grappin + cables on people attacking (or going to) the castle
- ADD: lanciers
- ADD: ladders and cords with people climbing.
- giant people ("boss"/hero), golden, in the battlefield.
- alone horse in battlefield
- IMPROVE: helmet variety
- as result of a fight (destruction map), the weapon/flag/... will be on the ground.
- Palisade:
  - work on a better entrance

GENERAL:
- Work on Features
- polish the projectile matcher to make it more logical.

MOUNTAIN:
- if we can allow castle to be on a mountain and have a mountain next to it where attackers are?

WORK ON DESTRUCTION:
- On the whole scene. Impacts all places.
- facteur de destruction (trous dans la muraille / explosions avec des morceaux en l'air.
- fire & smoke
- Slice the object and emit particles that can produce some fire.
- Dead battle field. (remains of weapons and flaks in the ground)

SEA:
- boats:
  - boat spawner to spawn add variety + flags.
  - mat de bateau
- reflection: reflect the particles?!
- reflection: dragon

FRONT MOUNTAIN:
- rework spawning. 
- camp area.
- animals?
- random obj and materials?
- ADD random event on the front. maybe a rock from very bottom that makes it "front front"
  - a warrior watching the scene, raising hands. with weapon.
  - flags
  - axe

IDEAS:
- defenders on the beach during trojan horse.
- for most object i think we need to allow them to go gold. in rare case.
- archer on top of an attacker tower. 
- ? for these specials. have special titles too.
- night time illumination: castle lights, attacker torches, firecamp
  - ADD: campfire near huts (it's an area)
- ADD post processing anim. add an invisible polygon to make a texture in the web side (replace to activate).
  - on sea (like (I) Primitive)
  - on the fires to make the glow & have some sort of moving effect
- ADD Random event on rock:
  - a nest
  - a weapon
  - an observer/lost person
- SPECIAL lockness event. 
- SPECIAL "zombie"/ghul mode. with the red moon. ref to zelda?
- IDEA: sky parametric equations with worms filling.
- can we optim perf of Filling?
