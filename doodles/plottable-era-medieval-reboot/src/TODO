PRIO:
- battlefield
  - people with machines & all other new objs
  - only place machines on opportunated locations (belier on door, cannon on mountain next to castle when possible, catapult and trebuchet far enough)
- fix castle destruction. fire/smoke that goes with it
- destruction map to impact battlefield too. we should also have a noise map for where the targets are
- test density of an extreme case of fire

CASTLE:
- rework castle
  - stairs => where we can find some empty space. typically in the big towers.
  - lights
- small decoration under the roof of a wall

BATTLEFIELD:
- organize ArmyOnMountain fight. divide the terrain. rework the code to add more kind of items and people.
  - we have to chose a count of units to spawn "globally". and we will have only one look to try to spawn where they can be.
- machines / caravans:
  - add folks on the machines.
  - attacker supposed to climp on the belfry
  - Belfry improvements.
  - human managing the cannon, with a torch to fire the canon.

MOUNTAIN:
- if we can allow castle to be on a mountain and have a mountain next to it where attackers are?

WORK ON DESTRUCTION:
- facteur de destruction (trous dans la muraille / explosions avec des morceaux en l'air.
- Slice the object and emit particles that can produce some fire.

FRONT MOUNTAIN:
- rework spawning.

- animals
- random obj and materials?
- ADD random event on the front. maybe a rock from very bottom that makes it "front front"
  - a warrior watching the scene, raising hands. with weapon.

IDEAS:
- ADD Random event on rock:
  - a nest
  - a weapon
  - an observer/lost person
- SPECIAL "zombie"/ghul mode. with the red moon. ref to zelda?
