  - lights & decorations

- better battlefield org. how to make a column of people , maybe the shields to be clipped before? sort by y?
- BUG when lowering precision at 0.1 there are some crash. let's run a lot of results to identify where.

MEDIUM:
- alone horse in battlefield
- add post processing anim. add an invisible polygon to make a texture in the web side (replace to activate).
  - on sea (like (I) Primitive)
  - on the fires to make the glow & have some sort of moving effect

==== on stream ====

- organize the ArmyOnMountain fight. divide the terrain. rework the code to add more kind of items and people.
  - we would use an area map.
  - make a neutral area. which could allow to spawn forest and wild animals.

- work on the destruction. fire. smoke.

Work on the lore on rare "events":
- lockness event. 
- polish the particle. they are sometimes starting off screen. also they need to be oriented to the castle. so maybe we need to store abstracted data and resolve at the end of the scene.
- "zombie"/ghul mode. with the red moon. ref to zelda?
- for these specials. have special titles too.
- dragon?! (lot of work, but what if i reuse my snake code)
