SKY:
- clouds rework. variety with Linear Clouds + Worms Filling Cloud. (Using a gradient of values).
- stars shapes
- work on sky background
  - noise field (nuit étoilée), like my storms. using all colors?
  - rains like in Heist.
  - full spiral around the sun.
  - parametric equations with worms filling.
- rethink sun position

CASTLE:
- fix the mountain shaping & castle position
- rework castle. prepare some new castle items to be placed on stream
  - flags
  - defenders on the walls
  - watch towers
  - stairs
  - lights & decorations
  - make vertical flag. from the flag clothes.
  - drawbridge

BATTLEFIELD:
- machines / caravans
  - merge Monk into Human. we need a concept of HoldingObject::Foreign
  - add folks on the machines.
  - do something with Cage. army transporting someone.
  - have a horse caravan version. where we can put relique / cage..
  - attacker supposed to climp on the belfry
- organize ArmyOnMountain fight. divide the terrain. rework the code to add more kind of items and people.
  - we would use an area map.
  - make them aligned into areas. for instance i want to see alignment of archers and alignement of shields.
  - make a neutral area. which could allow to spawn forest and wild animals.
  - y ordering of battlefield + split human rendering in 2 first human.render_foreground_only, then possible other object (including machines!), then background. there might be the same principle on the castle?
  - in the army, we need a leader. they will either have a flag OR a weapon that is bigger and colored with the team color.
- blazon & their impact + flags
  - on shield
  - on boat/belier head
- alone horse in battlefield
- ADD: dragon canon. throw fireball with lot of particle in direction to the castle.
- ADD: lanciers
- ADD: Catapult
- ADD: ladders and cords with people climbing.
- ADD: campfire near huts. (it's an area)

GENERAL:
- BUG when lowering precision at 0.1 there are some crash. let's run a lot of results to identify where.
- work on projectiles. add fire & smoke.
  - polish the particle. they are sometimes starting off screen. also they need to be oriented to the castle. so maybe we need to store abstracted data and resolve at the end of the scene.
- Work on Features

MOUNTAIN:
- ADD: palisade / wall. 'palisade medieval / great wall' to google. traverse la montagne + facteur de destruction (trous dans la muraille / explosions avec des morceaux en l'air)

SEA:
- boat spawner to spawn add variety.

FRONT MOUNTAIN:
- better animals spawning. can spawn on front too.
- ADD random event on the front. maybe a rock from very bottom that makes it "front front"
  - a warrior watching the scene, raising hands. with weapon.
  - flags
  - axe

IDEAS:
- giant people ("boss"). also when the size is high enough (level of detail), renders people with better than just wireframe. using dist func?
- rock should we fill them in case of white paper?
- archer on top of an attacker tower. 
- ? for these specials. have special titles too.
- ADD post processing anim. add an invisible polygon to make a texture in the web side (replace to activate).
  - on sea (like (I) Primitive)
  - on the fires to make the glow & have some sort of moving effect
- ADD Random event on rock:
  - a nest
  - a weapon
  - an observer/lost person
- SPECIAL lockness event. 
- SPECIAL "zombie"/ghul mode. with the red moon. ref to zelda?
