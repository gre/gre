- IDEA: observer/lost people on the rock :D
- IDEA: a warrior watching the scene from the front mountain. raising the hands. possibly with weapons on them. render using the worms filling. maybe we allow a rock to be present on the very bottom and it is on it? we can also put random stuff like Axe,... check list of objs : FLAGS!

==== on stream ====

- organize the ArmyOnMountain fight. divide the terrain. rework the code to add more kind of items and people.

- work on the destruction. fire. smoke.

Rare "Special":
- lockness event. 
- Excalibur. Eg on the rock
- Cheval de Troie. full gold.
- polish the particle. they are sometimes starting off screen. also they need to be oriented to the castle. so maybe we need to store abstracted data and resolve at the end of the scene.
- "zombie"/ghul mode. with the red moon. ref to zelda?
- for these specials. have special titles too.
